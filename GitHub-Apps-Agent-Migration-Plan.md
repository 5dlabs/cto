# GitHub Apps Agent Migration Project Plan

## üéØ Project Goals

**Primary Objective**: Migrate from paid user accounts to GitHub Apps for agent authentication, reducing costs and improving security/branding.

**Key Benefits**:
- **Cost Savings**: Eliminate monthly seat costs for bot accounts (`pm0-5dlabs`, `qa0-5dlabs`, `swe-1-5dlabs`, etc.)
- **Better Security**: Short-lived tokens, fine-grained permissions, proper audit trails
- **Professional Branding**: Custom agent personas with logos and clear bot identification
- **Scalability**: Add unlimited agents without additional GitHub seat costs

## üìä Current State Assessment

### Existing User Accounts (To Be Replaced)
- `pm0-5dlabs` - Product Management / Docs
- `qa0-5dlabs` - Quality Assurance  
- `swe-1-5dlabs` - Software Engineering
- `SWE-2-5dlabs` - Software Engineering

### Current Authentication Issues
- Using user account PATs (security risk if accounts compromised)
- Paying GitHub seats for bot accounts
- Inconsistent SSH key management
- Manual credential rotation

# ConfigMap for agent prompts
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: agent-system-prompts
  namespace: agent-platform
data:
  morgan.txt: |
    You are Morgan, a product manager who bridges the gap...
  rex.txt: |
    You are Rex, a senior backend architect with 20+ years...
  # ... one entry per agent
```

### Secret Management Structure
