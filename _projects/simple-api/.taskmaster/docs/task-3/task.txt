# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create Health and Welcome Endpoints
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement GET `/health` and GET `/` endpoints for health checks and API info.
# Details:
- In `/src/routes`, define routes for `/` and `/health`.
- `/` returns a JSON object with a welcome message, API version (from package.json), and current timestamp.
- `/health` returns server status (e.g., 'ok'), uptime (process.uptime()), and timestamp.
- Use controllers for response logic to keep routes clean.

# Test Strategy:
Send GET requests to `/` and `/health` and verify correct JSON structure and values.
