**Test**: Files exist with proper content

### 5. Package.json Completeness ✓

**Given** the main project file
**When** reviewing package.json
**Then** it must include:

```json
{
  "name": "simple-todo-api",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A lightweight REST API for managing todos",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "dev": "nodemon server.js",
    "test": "jest --coverage",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",

  },
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0"
  },
  "keywords": ["api", "rest", "todo", "express", "sqlite"],
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

### 6. Example Commands Validation ✓

**Given** documentation includes examples
**When** testing each example
**Then** all must work exactly as shown:

Test each README example:
```bash
# Create todo example
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/todos \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test","description":"Example"}'

# List with filters example  
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/todos?completed=true&limit=10"

# Update example
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/todos/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"completed":true}'
```

**Test**: Copy-paste each example - all must work

### 7. PRD Requirements Verification ✓

## Final Verification

Run final verification:
```bash
# 1. Run quality check
./scripts/check-project.sh

# 2. Test fresh install
# (in separate directory)

# 3. Review all documentation
# (manually check completeness)

# 4. Verify examples work
# (copy-paste each one)
```

## Notes

- This is the final task - ensure perfection
- Documentation is the first impression
- Examples must work exactly as shown
- Scripts should handle common errors
- Consider future developers' needs
- Make the project a joy to use
