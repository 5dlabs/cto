# Task ID: 8
# Title: Code Quality, Linting, and Final Review
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure code quality, readability, and adherence to best practices. Add linting and perform a final review.
# Details:
- Install and configure ESLint (`eslint@8`) with recommended Node.js/Express rules.
- Refactor code for clarity and modularity (controllers, routes, middleware separation).
- Remove unused code and ensure consistent formatting.
- Optionally, add Prettier for formatting consistency.
- Perform a final manual test of all endpoints and error scenarios.

# Test Strategy:
Run ESLint and Prettier, fix issues. Manually test all endpoints and review code for maintainability.
