# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Express Server and Middleware
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the Express server with JSON parsing, environment variable support, and clean startup logging.
# Details:
- In `/src/index.js`, set up the Express app.
- Use `express.json()` for JSON body parsing (built-in since Express 4.16+).
- Load environment variables with `dotenv`.
- Configure the server to listen on `process.env.PORT` or default to 3000.
- Add startup logging with timestamp and environment info.
- Follow best practices for middleware order and error handling setup.

# Test Strategy:
Start the server and confirm logs display correct port and environment. Send a test JSON request to verify parsing.
