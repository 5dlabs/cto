# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Security Hardening and Operational Procedures
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Perform security hardening of the infrastructure, implement network policies, configure secrets management, and create comprehensive operational runbooks.
# Details:
1. Implement network policies to restrict traffic:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: solana-validator-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: solana-validator
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: jupiter-api
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8899
  - ports:
    - protocol: UDP
      port: 8001
    - protocol: UDP
      port: 8002
  egress:
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
    ports:
    - protocol: UDP
      port: 8001
    - protocol: UDP
      port: 8002
```

2. Configure secrets management using Kubernetes secrets:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: solana-validator-identity
type: Opaque
data:
  validator-identity.json: <base64-encoded-identity>
```

3. Set up audit logging:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: audit-policy
data:
  policy.yaml: |
    apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Policy
    rules:
    - level: Metadata
      resources:
      - group: ""
        resources: ["pods"]
    - level: RequestResponse
      resources:
      - group: ""
        resources: ["secrets"]
```

4. Create comprehensive runbooks for common operations:
   - Validator startup and shutdown procedures
   - Snapshot creation and restoration
   - Performance troubleshooting
   - Network issue resolution
   - Failover procedures
   - Upgrade procedures

5. Document disaster recovery procedures
6. Implement regular security scanning
7. Configure resource quotas and limits

# Test Strategy:
1. Perform security audit of configurations
2. Test network policies by attempting unauthorized access
3. Verify secrets management with access attempts
4. Validate audit logging captures relevant events
5. Test runbook procedures with operations team
6. Conduct disaster recovery drill
7. Verify resource quotas prevent resource exhaustion
8. Test security scanning effectiveness

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement and Enforce Network Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and apply Kubernetes network policies to restrict ingress and egress traffic for Solana validator pods, ensuring only required communications are permitted.
### Details:
Create NetworkPolicy resources specifying allowed sources, destinations, and ports for both ingress and egress. Apply a default deny-all policy and then explicitly allow necessary traffic between validator and API pods, as well as required UDP/TCP ports.

## 2. Configure and Secure Secrets Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Set up Kubernetes secrets for storing sensitive data such as validator identities and credentials, ensuring proper access controls and encryption.
### Details:
Create Secret resources for validator identity files and other confidential information. Restrict access to secrets using RBAC policies and enable encryption at rest for secrets in the cluster.

## 3. Enable and Validate Audit Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Configure Kubernetes audit logging to capture and store security-relevant events, especially those related to pods and secrets.
### Details:
Deploy an audit policy via ConfigMap, specifying rules to log metadata for pod events and full request/response for secrets access. Ensure logs are collected and stored securely for later analysis.

## 4. Develop Comprehensive Operational Runbooks [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Create detailed runbooks covering validator operations, troubleshooting, failover, upgrades, and disaster recovery procedures.
### Details:
Document step-by-step procedures for startup/shutdown, snapshot management, performance troubleshooting, network issue resolution, failover, upgrades, and disaster recovery. Ensure runbooks are accessible and regularly updated.

## 5. Implement Security Scanning and Resource Quotas [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Set up regular security scanning of cluster resources and enforce resource quotas and limits to prevent resource exhaustion and maintain cluster stability.
### Details:
Integrate security scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities in images and configurations. Define and apply resource quotas and limits for CPU, memory, and storage at the namespace or pod level.
