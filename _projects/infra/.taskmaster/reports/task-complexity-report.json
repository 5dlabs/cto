			"taskTitle": "Build Custom Talos OS Image with Solana Optimizations",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of building a custom Talos OS image for Solana into subtasks covering: repository forking and build environment setup, kernel configuration for huge pages, NUMA, io_uring, and SR-IOV, custom kernel module development, gcompat integration, performance monitoring extension integration, YAML machine config templating, image build and publishing, and documentation. Include subtasks for validation and benchmarking of each optimization.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires deep OS-level customization, kernel development, hardware-specific tuning (NUMA, SR-IOV), compatibility layers, and integration with Solana-specific performance needs. Each step involves specialized knowledge and significant risk of regressions, demanding granular subtasks for build, test, and documentation. Industry best practices dictate modular kernel config, CI for image builds, and thorough benchmarking."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Provision Cherry Servers Infrastructure with Terraform",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: Terraform provider/module setup, infrastructure definition for each node type, storage configuration, network/SR-IOV setup, remote management (IPMI), output variable creation, state backend configuration, and deployment documentation. Include validation and benchmarking steps for each resource.",
			"reasoning": "Provisioning bare metal with Terraform is complex due to hardware, storage, and network specifics, especially with SR-IOV and high-performance requirements. Best practices require modular Terraform code, idempotent plans, and infrastructure validation. Each component (compute, storage, network, management) should be a subtask."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Deploy Talos OS Kubernetes Cluster",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose this task into subtasks for: generating Talos configs, applying NUMA/huge pages settings, bootstrapping control plane, joining worker/validator nodes, configuring storage, applying Kubernetes performance settings, verifying cluster health, and documenting deployment. Include subtasks for automated validation and failover testing.",
			"reasoning": "Deploying a custom OS image in a Kubernetes cluster with performance tuning (NUMA, huge pages) and storage configuration is non-trivial. Each phase (config, bootstrap, join, tune, verify) is a best-practice subtask. Automated health checks and documentation are essential for reliability."

		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Cilium CNI with eBPF Acceleration",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for: Cilium installation with Helm, kube-proxy replacement, BPF masquerade configuration, XDP program development and deployment, DDoS rate limiting, Hubble observability setup, network policy application, SR-IOV validation, and documentation. Include subtasks for eBPF/XDP testing and performance benchmarking.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating Cilium with eBPF/XDP and custom traffic prioritization is advanced networking work, requiring kernel-level programming, Kubernetes CNI expertise, and security best practices. Each configuration and validation step should be a subtask to ensure reliability and maintainability."

		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Build and Deploy Solana Validator Container",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for: Dockerfile creation, Solana build and version pinning, Yellowstone gRPC plugin integration, Kubernetes StatefulSet manifest creation, NUMA pinning setup, memory optimizer sidecar, storage class configuration, backup/snapshot automation, deployment validation, and documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Building a high-performance Solana validator container with NUMA pinning, custom plugins, and Kubernetes deployment involves advanced containerization, resource management, and stateful workload orchestration. Each aspect (build, deploy, optimize, backup) is a best-practice subtask."

			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Deploy Jupiter API with High Availability",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for: Dockerfile and build pipeline, Kubernetes Deployment and Service manifests, health check and failover logic, Yellowstone gRPC integration, market cache configuration, session affinity setup, and deployment validation. Include subtasks for HA/failover testing.",
			"reasoning": "Deploying a stateless API with HA, failover, and integration with a local validator is moderately complex. Best practices include readiness/liveness probes, session affinity, and automated failover logic, each meriting a subtask."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Monitoring and Observability",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for: Prometheus deployment, Grafana setup with dashboards, Solana exporter configuration, Hubble UI deployment, alerting rule creation, PagerDuty/Slack integration, dashboard customization, and validation/testing of observability stack.",
			"reasoning": "A robust monitoring stack for distributed systems requires careful setup of metrics, visualization, alerting, and integrations. Each component (Prometheus, Grafana, exporters, alerting) is a best-practice subtask, with validation for each."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Automated Operations and Self-Healing",

			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for: Kubernetes operator development, memory pressure detection, cache adjustment automation, snapshot backup automation, circuit breaker implementation, self-healing procedure scripting, ledger pruning automation, recovery procedure documentation, and validation/testing.",
			"reasoning": "Developing automated operations and self-healing for a stateful, high-performance workload is highly complex. Operator development, dynamic resource management, and automated recovery each require dedicated subtasks and rigorous testing."
