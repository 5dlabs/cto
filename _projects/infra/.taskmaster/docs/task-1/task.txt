  "description": "Create a custom Talos OS build with kernel optimizations specifically for Solana validator performance, including huge pages allocation, NUMA optimizations, and io_uring support.",
  "details": "1. Fork the Talos OS repository and set up build environment\n2. Configure kernel with the following optimizations:\n   - Static huge pages allocation (100GB at boot time)\n   - NUMA optimizations for AMD EPYC processors\n   - io_uring support for future Firedancer compatibility\n   - SR-IOV enablement for network acceleration\n3. Implement custom kernel module for runtime optimizations\n4. Add gcompat layer for glibc compatibility\n5. Integrate performance monitoring extensions\n6. Configure kernel parameters in machine config:\n   ```yaml\n   machine:\n     type: worker\n     install:\n       disk: /dev/nvme0n1\n       image: ghcr.io/our-org/installer:custom-solana-v1.10.3\n       extensions:\n         - image: ghcr.io/our-org/solana-optimizer:latest\n     kernel:\n       modules:\n         - tcp_bbr\n         - sch_fq\n     sysctls:\n       vm.max_map_count: 1048576\n       vm.dirty_ratio: 50\n       net.core.rmem_max: 268435456\n       net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control: bbr\n   ```\n7. Build and publish custom Talos installer image\n8. Document build process and configuration options",
  "testStrategy": "1. Benchmark custom vs stock kernel performance using sysbench and fio\n2. Verify huge pages allocation at boot time\n3. Test NUMA node affinity with numactl\n4. Validate io_uring performance with io_uring-test\n5. Confirm SR-IOV functionality with network tests\n6. Verify gcompat compatibility by running glibc-dependent applications\n7. Compare performance metrics against baseline systemd deployments",
