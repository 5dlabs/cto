# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Real-time Pool State Monitoring and Dynamic Slippage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system that monitors Solana DEX pool states in real-time and provides dynamic slippage calculations based on current liquidity conditions for more accurate trade simulation.
# Details:
1. Implement real-time pool state monitoring:
   - Create a `PoolStateMonitor` service that subscribes to pool account updates via gRPC
   - Support all major DEX protocols including Raydium, Orca, and other Jupiter-supported DEXs
   - Implement protocol-specific parsers for each DEX type:
     ```rust
     pub trait PoolStateParser: Send + Sync + 'static {
         fn parse_pool_state(&self, account_data: &[u8]) -> Result<PoolState, PoolParseError>;
         fn get_supported_program_ids(&self) -> Vec<Pubkey>;
     }
     
     pub struct RaydiumPoolParser;
     pub struct OrcaPoolParser;
     // Additional DEX parsers
     ```

2. Implement pool state caching in Redis:
   - Store parsed pool states with appropriate TTL (1-2 seconds)
   - Implement efficient serialization/deserialization for fast access
   - Create a cache invalidation strategy for account updates
   - Structure the Redis keys to allow for efficient querying by token pair

3. Develop liquidity depth analysis system:
   - Create functions to calculate available liquidity at different price points
   - Implement volume-based impact modeling based on historical data
   - Calculate liquidity concentration metrics to identify thin markets
   - Store liquidity depth snapshots in QuestDB for historical analysis

4. Implement dynamic slippage model:
   - Create a `SlippageCalculator` that considers:
     - Current pool liquidity depth
     - Recent volume patterns (from QuestDB historical data)
     - Trade size relative to pool size
     - Historical slippage patterns for similar trades
   - Implement adaptive slippage algorithm:
     ```rust
     pub fn calculate_dynamic_slippage(
         &self,
         pool_state: &PoolState,
         trade_amount: u64,
         token_mint: &Pubkey,
         recent_volume: &VolumeMetrics
     ) -> SlippageEstimate {
         // Dynamic slippage calculation logic
         // Returns base slippage + dynamic adjustment
     }
     ```

5. Integrate with paper trade executor:
   - Modify the paper trade executor to use dynamic slippage calculations
   - Implement realistic price impact simulation based on current pool state
   - Create a feedback loop that improves slippage models based on actual vs. predicted slippage

6. Implement pool health monitoring:
   - Track key pool health metrics (liquidity depth, volume, price impact)
   - Create warning thresholds for low liquidity or unstable pools
   - Integrate with circuit breaker system to pause trading on unhealthy pools
   - Implement automatic alerts for significant pool state changes

7. Create a pool registry system:
   - Maintain a registry of all monitored pools with metadata
   - Support dynamic addition/removal of pools to monitor
   - Track pool reliability metrics and health status
   - Prioritize subscription resources based on trading activity

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit testing:
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for each DEX parser with sample account data
   - Test slippage calculation with various pool states and trade sizes
   - Verify Redis caching with mock Redis implementation
   - Test pool health monitoring with simulated unhealthy conditions

2. Integration testing:
   - Set up integration tests with local Solana validator and DEX programs
   - Create test pools with controlled liquidity conditions
   - Verify real-time updates are processed correctly
   - Test end-to-end flow from pool state change to slippage calculation

3. Performance testing:
   - Benchmark Redis cache performance to ensure <1ms read times
   - Test system under high update frequency (100+ pool updates per second)
   - Verify memory usage remains stable during extended operation
   - Measure latency between pool state change and slippage model update

4. Accuracy testing:
   - Compare predicted slippage with actual execution results
   - Create historical backtests using recorded pool states and trades
   - Calculate error metrics (RMSE, MAE) for slippage predictions
   - Verify improvement over static slippage models

5. Resilience testing:
   - Test behavior when pools become unavailable or corrupted
   - Verify circuit breaker integration works correctly for unhealthy pools
   - Test recovery after Redis cache failure
   - Simulate network issues with gRPC connection and verify recovery
