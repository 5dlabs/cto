# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement gRPC Connection to Solana Node
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a resilient gRPC client for connecting to Solana nodes with health monitoring and circuit breaker integration
# Details:
1. Implement a gRPC client for Solana using the latest Solana gRPC specifications:
   - Support for transaction submission
   - Subscription to account updates
   - Block and slot monitoring

2. Add health monitoring capabilities:
   - Track latency with rolling window statistics
   - Monitor error rates and connection status
   - Implement P99 latency calculation for circuit breaker

3. Integrate circuit breaker pattern:
   - Implement Open/Closed/Half-open states
   - Configure 200ms latency threshold as specified
   - Add exponential backoff for reconnection attempts

Example implementation:
```rust
pub struct SolanaGrpcClient {
    client: GrpcClient,
    health_metrics: Arc<RwLock<HealthMetrics>>,
    circuit_breaker: Arc<RwLock<CircuitBreaker>>,
}

impl SolanaGrpcClient {
    pub async fn submit_transaction(&self, tx: Transaction) -> Result<Signature> {
        // Check circuit breaker before proceeding
        if !self.circuit_breaker.read().await.is_closed() {
            return Err(Error::CircuitBreakerOpen);
        }
        
        let start = Instant::now();
        let result = self.client.submit_transaction(tx).await;
        let latency = start.elapsed();
        
        // Update health metrics
        self.health_metrics.write().await.record_latency(latency);
        if result.is_err() {
            self.health_metrics.write().await.record_error();
            
            // Check if we need to open the circuit breaker
            let metrics = self.health_metrics.read().await;
            if metrics.p99_latency() > Duration::from_millis(200) || metrics.error_rate() > 0.05 {
                self.circuit_breaker.write().await.open();
            }
        }
        
        result
    }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for the gRPC client with mocked Solana responses. Implement integration tests against a local Solana test validator. Test circuit breaker behavior by simulating high latency and error conditions. Verify P99 latency calculation accuracy. Ensure proper failover behavior when circuit breaker opens.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core gRPC Client for Solana [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the foundational gRPC client that can connect to Solana nodes, submit transactions, and subscribe to account updates.
### Details:
Create a gRPC client implementation that handles: 1) Connection establishment with Solana nodes, 2) Transaction submission with proper serialization/deserialization, 3) Account subscription mechanism for real-time updates, 4) Basic error handling and retry logic, 5) Proper resource management (connection pooling), and 6) Authentication if required by the Solana gRPC endpoints.

## 2. Develop Health Monitoring System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a comprehensive health monitoring system that tracks latency metrics and calculates P99 statistics for the gRPC client.
### Details:
Implement a monitoring system that: 1) Records request/response latencies for all gRPC calls, 2) Maintains a sliding window of latency measurements, 3) Calculates P99 latency values in real-time, 4) Provides interfaces to query current health status, 5) Implements configurable thresholds for health determination, and 6) Logs detailed metrics for external monitoring systems.

## 3. Integrate Circuit Breaker Pattern [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Implement a circuit breaker mechanism that manages connection state and handles reconnection logic based on health monitoring data.
### Details:
Develop a circuit breaker that: 1) Maintains connection state (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF-OPEN), 2) Transitions between states based on error rates and health metrics, 3) Implements backoff strategies for reconnection attempts, 4) Provides hooks for custom failure detection logic, 5) Handles graceful degradation when connections fail, and 6) Exposes state change events for monitoring and logging.
