# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Live Trade Executor with Real Transaction Execution
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 6, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a robust live trading execution engine that can execute real transactions on Solana with comprehensive risk management, circuit breaker integration, and transaction confirmation monitoring.
# Details:
1. Implement core transaction execution system:
   - Create a transaction builder that constructs Solana transactions for Jupiter V6 swaps
   - Implement priority fee calculation based on network congestion (using recent blockhash fee analysis)
   - Add MEV protection parameters to Jupiter V6 API calls (slippage tolerance, priority fees)
   - Implement transaction signing using the wallet manager

2. Integrate comprehensive risk management:
   - Implement pre-trade validation checks:
     - Verify sufficient balance for trade + fees
     - Check that trade size is within configured limits
     - Validate that token is on approved list
     - Ensure circuit breaker is in closed state
   - Create transaction simulation before execution to verify expected outcome
   - Implement maximum slippage protection with configurable thresholds

3. Implement circuit breaker integration:
   - Check circuit breaker status before initiating any transaction
   - Automatically pause trading when circuit breaker opens
   - Implement graceful handling of trades in progress when circuit breaker triggers
   - Add logging and alerting for circuit breaker state changes

4. Create transaction confirmation monitoring:
   - Implement confirmation polling with configurable timeout
   - Add exponential backoff retry logic for failed transactions
   - Track transaction signatures and status in QuestDB
   - Create detailed error categorization for failed transactions

5. Implement error handling and recovery:
   - Create robust error handling for network issues
   - Implement transaction timeout and cancellation logic
   - Add automatic retry for specific error conditions
   - Create comprehensive logging for all transaction states

6. Implement trade recording in QuestDB:
   - Record all transaction details including:
     - Transaction signature
     - Execution timestamp
     - Token pair and amounts
     - Execution price and slippage
     - Priority fees paid
     - Confirmation time
   - Create indexes for efficient querying of trade history

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit testing:
   - Create comprehensive tests for transaction building with various token pairs
   - Test priority fee calculation with different network conditions
   - Verify risk management checks with valid and invalid trade parameters
   - Test circuit breaker integration with all possible states
   - Verify error handling with simulated failure conditions

2. Integration testing:
   - Test against Solana devnet with real transactions
   - Verify transaction confirmation monitoring with various network conditions
   - Test integration with wallet manager for transaction signing
   - Verify QuestDB recording of transaction details
   - Test circuit breaker triggering during active transactions

3. End-to-end testing:
   - Create automated test suite that executes small real trades
   - Verify complete transaction flow from initiation to confirmation
   - Test recovery from simulated network failures
   - Verify proper handling of transaction timeouts
   - Test MEV protection parameters with real Jupiter V6 API

4. Performance testing:
   - Measure transaction execution latency under various conditions
   - Test system under high transaction volume
   - Verify resource usage during peak operation
   - Test recovery time after circuit breaker events

5. Security testing:
   - Conduct code review focused on transaction security
   - Verify proper handling of private keys and signing
   - Test for potential transaction manipulation vulnerabilities
   - Verify proper error handling for security-critical operations
