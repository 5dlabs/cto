# Task 3: Acceptance Criteria

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Core gRPC Client
- [ ] **Connection Management**:
  - Establishes gRPC connection to Solana node
  - 5-second connection timeout configured
  - 10-second TCP keep-alive enabled
  - Connection pooling implemented
- [ ] **Transaction Submission**:
  - `send_transaction()` method with 200ms timeout
  - Proper transaction serialization
  - Signature extraction from response
  - Error mapping to custom types
- [ ] **Account Subscription**:
  - Subscribe to multiple account updates
  - Stream handler for continuous updates
  - Proper cleanup on stream termination
  - Backpressure handling

### 2. Health Monitoring
- [ ] **Latency Tracking**:
  - Sliding window of 1000 measurements
  - Per-operation metrics collection
  - Real-time percentile calculation (P50, P95, P99)
  - Sub-millisecond metric calculation time
- [ ] **Error Tracking**:
  - Error count and rate calculation
  - Last error message storage
  - Per-operation error rates
  - Success/failure ratio tracking
- [ ] **Health Status**:
  - `is_healthy()` returns false when P99 > 200ms
  - Health check when error rate > 5%
  - Exportable metrics structure
  - Thread-safe metric updates

### 3. Circuit Breaker
- [ ] **State Management**:
  - Three states: Closed, Open, Half-Open
  - State transitions based on failures
  - 5 failure threshold for opening
  - 30-second recovery timeout
- [ ] **Half-Open Behavior**:
  - Allows up to 3 test requests
  - Success closes circuit
  - Failure reopens circuit
  - Request counting in half-open state
- [ ] **Integration**:
  - Blocks requests when open
  - Updates on operation results
  - Thread-safe state changes
  - State change logging

### 4. Retry Logic
- [ ] **Exponential Backoff**:
  - Initial delay: 100ms
  - Doubles each retry (100ms, 200ms, 400ms)
  - Maximum 3 retries
  - Total retry time < 1 second
- [ ] **Retry Conditions**:
  - Only retries transient errors
  - Respects circuit breaker state
  - Skips non-recoverable errors
  - Configurable retry policy

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- [ ] All gRPC calls timeout at 200ms
- [ ] Health metric calculation < 1ms
- [ ] Circuit breaker check < 100Î¼s
- [ ] Zero allocations in hot path

### Reliability
- [ ] Graceful handling of connection loss
- [ ] No panic on malformed responses
- [ ] Clean shutdown of streams
- [ ] Resource cleanup on drop

### Observability
- [ ] Structured logging for all state changes
- [ ] Metrics export in standard format
- [ ] Trace IDs for request correlation
- [ ] Debug logs for troubleshooting

## Test Cases

### Health Monitoring Tests
```rust
// Test 1: Percentile accuracy
Input: 100 latencies from 1ms to 100ms
Expected: P50=50ms, P95=95ms, P99=99ms

// Test 2: Sliding window
Input: 1500 measurements
Expected: Only last 1000 in calculations

// Test 3: Error rate
Input: 10 failures out of 100 requests
Expected: error_rate = 0.10
```

### Circuit Breaker Tests
```rust
// Test 1: Opening circuit
Input: 5 consecutive failures
Expected: State = Open, requests blocked

// Test 2: Recovery timeout
Input: Wait 30 seconds after open
Expected: State = Half-Open

// Test 3: Successful recovery
Input: Success in half-open state
Expected: State = Closed, counters reset
```

### Integration Tests
```rust
// Test 1: High latency handling
Input: Server with 250ms latency
Expected: Timeout error, circuit breaker trips

// Test 2: Retry behavior
Input: Transient network error
Expected: 3 retries with backoff, then failure

// Test 3: Stream resilience
Input: Account stream with intermittent errors
Expected: Stream continues, errors logged
```

## Load Testing Requirements

### Sustained Load Test
```rust
// 1000 requests/second for 60 seconds
- P99 latency < 200ms throughout
- No memory leaks
- Circuit breaker remains closed
- All requests succeed
```

### Failure Recovery Test
```rust
// Inject 50% failures for 10 seconds
- Circuit breaker opens within 1 second
- Stops sending requests to node
- Recovers when failures stop
- Metrics accurately reflect state
```

### Concurrent Access Test
```rust
// 100 concurrent tasks using client
- No race conditions
- Metrics remain accurate
- Circuit breaker state consistent
- No deadlocks
```
