# Task 3: Implement gRPC Connection to Solana Node - Autonomous Prompt

You are implementing a resilient gRPC client for connecting to Solana nodes in a high-frequency trading platform. The client must maintain sub-200ms latency while handling failures gracefully through health monitoring and circuit breaker patterns.

## Context

The trading platform requires ultra-low latency communication with Solana nodes for transaction submission and real-time account monitoring. The gRPC client is critical infrastructure that must:
- Maintain P99 latency under 200ms (PRD requirement)
- Automatically disconnect when performance degrades
- Provide health metrics for system observability
- Handle network failures with exponential backoff

## Your Objectives

1. **Implement Core gRPC Client**
   - Create a client using Tonic for Solana's Geyser gRPC service
   - Support transaction submission with <200ms timeout
   - Implement account subscription for real-time updates
   - Add connection pooling and keep-alive settings

2. **Build Health Monitoring System**
   - Track latency with sliding window (last 1000 requests)
   - Calculate P50, P95, P99 percentiles in real-time
   - Monitor error rates and connection status
   - Provide per-operation metrics tracking

3. **Integrate Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Implement three states: Closed (normal), Open (blocking), Half-Open (testing)
   - Trip circuit when P99 > 200ms or error rate > 5%
   - 30-second recovery timeout before testing
   - Allow 3 test requests in half-open state

4. **Add Retry Logic**
   - Exponential backoff starting at 100ms
   - Maximum 3 retries for transient failures
   - Skip retries for non-recoverable errors
   - Respect circuit breaker state

## Implementation Requirements

### Proto Definitions
```proto
service Geyser {
    rpc Subscribe(SubscribeRequest) returns (stream SubscribeUpdate);
    rpc SendTransaction(SendTransactionRequest) returns (SendTransactionResponse);
}

message SubscribeRequest {
    repeated AccountFilter accounts = 1;
    bool slots = 2;
    bool transactions = 3;
    bool blocks = 4;
}

message SendTransactionRequest {
    bytes transaction = 1;
    bool skip_preflight = 2;
}
```

### Error Handling
- Define custom error types for circuit breaker states
- Distinguish between transient and permanent failures
- Provide detailed error context for debugging
- Never expose sensitive connection details in logs

### Performance Requirements
- Connection timeout: 5 seconds
- Request timeout: 200ms (all operations)
- Keep-alive interval: 10 seconds
- Health check calculation: <1ms

### Monitoring Output
The health monitor should track:
- Total request count
- Failed request count
- Error rate percentage
- P50, P95, P99 latencies
- Per-operation breakdown

## Testing Strategy

Create comprehensive tests for:

1. **Health Monitoring**:
   - Percentile calculation accuracy
   - Sliding window behavior
   - Concurrent access safety

2. **Circuit Breaker**:
   - State transitions (Closed → Open → Half-Open → Closed)
   - Recovery timeout behavior
   - Concurrent request handling

3. **Integration Tests**:
   - Mock Solana server with configurable latency
   - Simulate network failures
   - Verify retry behavior
   - Test under load conditions

4. **Performance Tests**:
   - Measure overhead of monitoring
   - Verify <200ms timeout enforcement
   - Test connection pooling efficiency

## Deliverables

1. **Core Implementation**:
   - `grpc_client.rs` with SolanaGrpcClient
   - `health_monitor.rs` with metrics tracking
   - `circuit_breaker.rs` with state management
   - Error types and retry policies

2. **Integration Code**:
   - Account subscription stream handler
   - Transaction submission with monitoring
   - Connection management utilities

3. **Tests**:
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests with mock server
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Load testing scenarios

4. **Documentation**:
   - API documentation for public methods
   - Configuration guide
   - Monitoring integration examples
   - Troubleshooting guide

## Success Criteria

- Client maintains P99 latency <200ms under normal conditions
- Circuit breaker trips within 5 failures
- Health metrics update in real-time
- All tests pass including load tests
- Zero memory leaks or resource exhaustion
- Clean disconnection on shutdown
- Proper async/await usage throughout
- Comprehensive error handling with actionable messages
