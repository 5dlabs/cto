# Task 12: Implement QuestDB Integration for Trade Data and Metrics - Acceptance Criteria

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Database Connection and Initialization
- [ ] QuestDB client connects successfully with provided connection string
- [ ] Connection pool maintains 5-10 active connections
- [ ] Schema initialization creates all required tables

- [ ] Initialization is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

### 2. Table Schemas
- [ ] Trades table includes all fields from Enhanced Trade Model
- [ ] Performance metrics table supports multiple metric types
- [ ] MEV metrics table tracks protection effectiveness
- [ ] Latency metrics table captures service-level timings

- [ ] Timestamp columns are properly designated

### 3. Batch Writing System
- [ ] Batch writer flushes every 100ms (±10ms tolerance)
- [ ] Multiple record types can be added to same batch
- [ ] Early flush triggers when batch size exceeds limit
- [ ] Failed writes are retried with exponential backoff

- [ ] Token filtering works for both base and quote
- [ ] Performance metric aggregations are accurate
- [ ] MEV analysis calculations are correct
- [ ] Query results are properly typed

### 6. Data Retention
- [ ] Retention job runs daily
- [ ] Partitions older than 30 days are dropped
- [ ] Retention doesn't affect active partitions
- [ ] Disk space is reclaimed after cleanup
- [ ] Retention operations are logged
- [ ] Partial failures don't stop entire job

## Performance Requirements

### 3. Batch Timing
- [ ] Average batch interval: 100ms ± 5ms
- [ ] P99 batch interval: <150ms
- [ ] No batches exceed 200ms interval
- [ ] Timing remains consistent under load

### 4. Connection Pool
- [ ] Pool utilization exceeds 90% under load
- [ ] Failed connections are replaced automatically
- [ ] Connection timeout is enforced (5 seconds)
- [ ] Idle connections are recycled
- [ ] Pool size adjusts to load

## Reliability Requirements

### 1. Error Handling
- [ ] Connection failures trigger automatic retry
- [ ] Write failures don't lose data
- [ ] Query timeouts return partial results
- [ ] Invalid data is rejected with clear errors
- [ ] All errors are logged with context

### 2. Data Integrity
- [ ] No duplicate records are inserted
- [ ] Batch atomicity is maintained
- [ ] Partial batch failures are handled
- [ ] Data types are validated before insert
- [ ] Timestamps are in UTC

### 3. Recovery
- [ ] Client recovers from database restart
- [ ] Queued writes persist through failures
- [ ] Connection pool rebuilds after outage
- [ ] No data corruption on abnormal shutdown

## Integration Requirements

### 1. Trade Data Integration
- [ ] Receives trade records from PaperTradeExecutor
- [ ] All trade fields are correctly mapped
- [ ] MEV protection status is recorded
- [ ] Trade metadata is preserved

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Latency metrics are recorded for all operations
- [ ] Success/failure rates are tracked
- [ ] Resource usage is monitored
- [ ] Batch write performance is logged

### 3. Query Access
- [ ] Correlation analyzer can query trade history
- [ ] Performance monitor can access metrics
- [ ] TUI can retrieve recent trades
- [ ] APIs support pagination

## Test Scenarios

### 1. High-Volume Write Test
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_high_volume_writes() {
    // Generate 100,000 trades
    // Write over 10 seconds
    // Verify: All trades persisted
    // Verify: No data loss
    // Verify: Batch timing maintained
}
```

### 2. Query Performance Test
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_query_performance() {
    // Insert 1 million records
    // Query last 24 hours
    // Verify: Response time <100ms
    // Verify: Results accurate
}
```

### 3. Retention Policy Test
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_retention_cleanup() {
    // Insert data across 35 days
    // Run retention job
    // Verify: Only 30 days retained
    // Verify: Disk space reclaimed
}
```

### 4. Failure Recovery Test
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_database_failure_recovery() {
    // Start writing data
    // Stop QuestDB
    // Continue writing (should queue)
    // Restart QuestDB
    // Verify: Queued data written
    // Verify: No data loss
}
```

### 5. Concurrent Access Test
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_concurrent_operations() {
    // 10 threads writing
    // 10 threads querying
    // Verify: No deadlocks
    // Verify: Consistent performance
}
```

### 6. Memory Stability Test
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_memory_stability() {
    // Run for 1 hour
    // Continuous writes at max rate
    // Monitor memory usage
    // Verify: No memory leaks
    // Verify: Stable memory footprint
}
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### 1. Operational Metrics
