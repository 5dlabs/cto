# Task 18: Acceptance Criteria

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Core Risk Management Components
- [ ] **RiskManager Implementation**:
  - Centralizes all technical risk validation
  - Maintains configurable thresholds via `RiskConfig`
  - Provides single entry point for validation
  - Calculates risk scores (0.0 to 1.0 range)
  - Supports async validation pipeline
- [ ] **Configuration Management**:
  - `RiskConfig` struct with all threshold fields
  - Default values match PRD specifications
  - Configuration persists across restarts
  - Runtime configuration updates supported
  - Validation of configuration changes
- [ ] **Validation Pipeline**:
  - Executes checks in correct order
  - Short-circuits on critical failures
  - Aggregates warnings and errors
  - Records validation timing metrics
  - Returns comprehensive `ValidationResult`

### 2. Execution Parameter Validation
- [ ] **Slippage Validation**:
  - Rejects trades exceeding `max_slippage_bps`
  - Warns when slippage >80% of limit
  - Default limit: 500 bps (5%)
  - Configurable per risk profile
- [ ] **MEV Protection Checks**:
  - Enforces MEV protection when required
  - Validates priority fee within range
  - Default range: 1000-10000 lamports
  - Warns on suboptimal fee levels
- [ ] **Timeout Validation**:
  - Minimum confirmation time: 100ms
  - Maximum confirmation time: 30000ms
  - Rejects too-short timeouts
  - Warns on excessive timeouts

### 3. System Health Monitoring
- [ ] **Node Health Checks**:
  - Monitors P99 latency every 10 seconds
  - Triggers at >200ms latency (PRD requirement)
  - Tracks connection status
  - Calculates health score (0.0-1.0)
- [ ] **Service Health Monitoring**:
  - Checks Jupiter availability
  - Monitors RPC node status
  - Tracks service-specific error rates
  - Fails validation if critical services down
- [ ] **Error Rate Tracking**:
  - 5-minute rolling window
  - Fails at >5% error rate
  - Categorizes errors by type
  - Provides detailed breakdowns

### 4. Circuit Breaker Integration
- [ ] **Circuit Breaker Checks**:
  - Validates all breakers are open before trade
  - Returns specific error for closed breakers
  - Lists which breakers are closed
  - Supports breaker-specific messages
- [ ] **Failure Registration**:
  - Records node timeouts
  - Records Jupiter errors
  - Records transaction failures
  - Triggers breaker after threshold
- [ ] **Recovery Mechanism**:
  - Automatic recovery after timeout
  - Half-open state for testing
  - Manual reset capability
  - Logs all state transitions

### 5. Risk Metrics and Monitoring
- [ ] **Validation Metrics**:
  - Records validation time (microseconds)
  - Tracks approval/rejection rates
  - Counts warnings by type
  - Stores in time-series database
- [ ] **Risk Score Tracking**:
  - Updates risk score gauge
  - Historical score tracking
  - Aggregated score statistics
  - Score breakdown by component
- [ ] **Violation Recording**:
  - Categorizes violations by type
  - Assigns severity levels
  - Includes detailed context
  - Enables violation queries
- [ ] **Dashboard Data**:
  - Current system risk score
  - Validations per minute
  - Recent violations list
  - Circuit breaker summary
  - System health overview

### 6. Override Capabilities
- [ ] **Override Creation**:
  - Requires authentication token
  - Maximum 24-hour duration
  - Mandatory reason field
  - Supports multiple override types
  - Returns unique override ID
- [ ] **Override Types**:
  - Slippage limit override
  - Circuit breaker bypass
  - System health override
  - All checks override
- [ ] **Override Management**:
  - Automatic expiration
  - Manual revocation
  - Active override listing
  - Audit trail for all actions
- [ ] **Security Controls**:
  - Permission verification
  - Rate limiting on creation
  - Encrypted storage
  - Tamper-evident logging

## Test Cases

### Validation Tests
```rust
// Test 1: Valid trade passes all checks
Input: Standard trade request, healthy system
Expected: ValidationResult { approved: true, warnings: [], risk_score: >0.9 }

// Test 2: Excessive slippage rejected
Input: Trade with 1000 bps slippage (limit: 500)
Expected: SlippageExceedsLimit error

// Test 3: Circuit breaker closed
Input: Any trade when circuit breaker closed
Expected: CircuitBreakerClosed error with breaker names
```

### Health Monitoring Tests
```rust
// Test 1: High node latency
Setup: Node P99 latency = 300ms
Expected: SystemUnhealthy error, degraded health score

// Test 2: Service unavailable
Setup: Jupiter service marked as down
Expected: CriticalServiceDown("jupiter") error

// Test 3: High error rate
Setup: 10% error rate in 5-min window
Expected: SystemUnhealthy with error rate details
```

### Override Tests
```rust
// Test 1: Create slippage override
Input: Override request for 1000 bps limit, 60 min duration
Expected: Override created, new limit applied

// Test 2: Override expiration
Setup: Create 1-minute override, wait 2 minutes
Expected: Override automatically removed

// Test 3: Invalid override request
Input: Override for 25 hours duration
Expected: InvalidOverride error
```

### Performance Tests
```rust
// Test 1: Validation latency
Process: 10,000 sequential validations
Expected: P99 < 1ms, P50 < 500Î¼s

// Test 2: Concurrent validations
Process: 100 parallel validation requests
Expected: All complete without contention

// Test 3: Memory stability
Process: 1 million validations
Expected: Stable memory usage, no leaks
```

### Integration Tests
```rust
// Test 1: With paper trader
Setup: Risk manager + paper trader integration
Process: Validate and execute trade
Expected: Risk validation before execution

// Test 2: With live trader
Setup: Risk manager + live trader integration
Process: High-risk trade attempt
Expected: Trade rejected by risk checks

// Test 3: Mock implementation
Setup: Use MockRiskManager
Process: Configure always_approve behavior
Expected: All trades pass validation
```
