# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Risk Management System with Pre-trade Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 6, 13, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a focused risk management system that validates technical execution aspects of trades before execution, ensuring safe transaction processing for pre-approved trade requests from external services.
# Details:
1. Implement core execution risk validation components:
   - Create a `RiskManager` struct that centralizes all execution risk checks
   - Implement pre-trade validation for execution parameters:
     - Maximum slippage tolerance enforcement
     - MEV protection validation
     - Node health verification
     - Circuit breaker status check
   - Design persistent configuration system for risk thresholds

2. Implement transaction monitoring and safety mechanisms:
   - Create transaction confirmation tracking
   - Implement retry logic with configurable parameters
   - Add transaction timeout handling
   - Implement gas price optimization for transaction safety

3. Integrate with circuit breaker system:
   - Connect risk manager to circuit breaker for automatic trading halts
   - Implement technical risk-based circuit breaker triggers (e.g., node failures, network issues)
   - Create recovery mechanism with manual override capabilities

4. Implement execution risk metrics and monitoring:
   - Calculate key execution metrics (confirmation times, failure rates, etc.)
   - Create real-time system health dashboard data
   - Implement violation reporting and alerting system
   - Add logging for all risk decisions and validations

5. Create risk override capabilities:
   - Implement secure override mechanism for authorized users
   - Add audit logging for all override actions
   - Create temporary override with automatic expiration

6. Integration with trading systems:
   - Connect risk manager to both paper and live trading executors
   - Implement consistent validation interface for both modes
   - Create mock risk manager for testing purposes
   - Ensure proper handling of TradeRequest objects from external services

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit testing:
   - Create comprehensive tests for all execution risk validation functions
   - Test slippage tolerance enforcement with different market conditions
   - Test MEV protection mechanisms with simulated front-running scenarios
   - Verify circuit breaker integration with simulated technical risk events
   - Test transaction confirmation and retry logic with various network conditions

2. Integration testing:
   - Create end-to-end tests that validate execution risk checks in the trade flow
   - Test persistence of risk configurations across system restarts
   - Verify integration with both paper and live trading executors
   - Test override functionality with proper authentication
   - Verify alert generation for execution risk violations
   - Test proper handling of TradeRequest objects from external services

3. Performance testing:
   - Benchmark risk validation to ensure minimal latency impact
   - Test system under high-frequency trading conditions
   - Verify concurrent validation requests are handled properly

4. Scenario testing:
   - Create specific execution risk scenarios (node failure, network congestion)
   - Test system behavior during extreme network conditions
   - Verify circuit breaker activation during technical risk events
   - Test transaction retry logic during temporary network issues
