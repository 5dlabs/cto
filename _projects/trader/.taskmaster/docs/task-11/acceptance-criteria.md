# Task 11: Implement Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Monitoring - Acceptance Criteria

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Position Monitoring Service
- [ ] Service starts successfully and begins monitoring immediately
- [ ] Monitoring occurs precisely every 100ms (±5ms tolerance)
- [ ] All positions in the portfolio are checked in each cycle
- [ ] Monitoring continues indefinitely until explicitly stopped
- [ ] Missed ticks are skipped rather than queued

### 2. Stop-Loss Orders
- [ ] Fixed stop-loss triggers when price drops to or below trigger price
- [ ] Trailing stop-loss updates high water mark when price increases
- [ ] Trailing stop maintains correct distance from high water mark
- [ ] Stop-loss executes full position sale when triggered
- [ ] Multiple stop-loss orders can exist for different positions
- [ ] Stop-loss orders persist across application restarts

### 3. Take-Profit Orders
- [ ] Take-profit triggers when price rises to or above trigger price
- [ ] Partial take-profit sells only specified percentage
- [ ] Full take-profit liquidates entire position
- [ ] Multiple take-profit levels can be set for same position
- [ ] Take-profit orders can coexist with stop-loss orders

### 4. Order Execution
- [ ] Triggered orders execute within the same 100ms cycle
- [ ] Trade parameters include correct amounts and tokens
- [ ] MEV protection is applied to all triggered trades
- [ ] Order metadata includes trigger information
- [ ] Failed executions are logged but don't stop monitoring
- [ ] Successful executions remove the order from active list

### 5. Order Management API
- [ ] `add_stop_loss()` creates order and returns unique ID
- [ ] `add_take_profit()` creates order with optional partial percentage
- [ ] `cancel_order()` removes order and returns success status
- [ ] `get_active_orders()` returns all pending orders
- [ ] Order IDs are unique (UUID v4)
- [ ] Invalid parameters are rejected with clear errors

### 6. Advanced Order Types
- [ ] Time-based orders trigger after specified duration
- [ ] Composite conditions with AND logic require all conditions
- [ ] Composite conditions with OR logic require any condition
- [ ] Percentage-based amounts calculate correctly from position size
- [ ] Fixed amounts execute regardless of position size

## Performance Requirements

### 1. Monitoring Latency
- [ ] Average monitoring cycle completes in <50ms
- [ ] P99 monitoring cycle completes in <100ms
- [ ] No monitoring cycle exceeds 200ms
- [ ] Performance warnings logged for cycles >50ms

### 2. Scalability
- [ ] Handles 50+ positions without performance degradation
- [ ] Supports 200+ active orders across all positions
- [ ] Parallel processing utilizes available CPU cores
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable over 24-hour period

### 3. Price Access
- [ ] Redis price lookups complete in <1ms
- [ ] Missing prices don't block other position checks
- [ ] Price cache hit rate exceeds 95%
- [ ] Stale prices (>2 seconds) are rejected

## Accuracy Requirements

### 1. Price Triggers
- [ ] Stop-loss triggers at exact price or first price below
- [ ] Take-profit triggers at exact price or first price above
- [ ] Trailing stop distance maintains precision to 4 decimal places
- [ ] High water marks update only on price increases

### 2. Order Amounts
- [ ] Full position orders include entire balance
- [ ] Percentage orders calculate to 4 decimal places
- [ ] Fixed amounts execute exactly as specified
- [ ] Partial executions update position correctly

### 3. Timing
- [ ] Orders trigger in the first cycle where conditions are met
- [ ] No orders are missed due to timing issues
- [ ] Monitoring interval variance is <5ms

## Integration Requirements

### 1. Portfolio Integration
- [ ] Reads current positions from VirtualPortfolio
- [ ] Position updates reflect in next monitoring cycle
- [ ] Concurrent access doesn't cause deadlocks

### 2. Price Cache Integration
- [ ] Successfully connects to Redis price cache
- [ ] Handles cache misses gracefully
- [ ] Falls back to direct price queries if needed

### 3. Trade Executor Integration
- [ ] Orders submit successfully to PaperTradeExecutor
- [ ] Trade results are properly handled
- [ ] Execution errors don't crash monitor

### 4. Event Publishing
- [ ] Order triggers publish to Redis event stream
- [ ] Execution results publish with full details
- [ ] Events include order ID and trigger metadata

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Stop-Loss Test
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_basic_stop_loss() {
    // Setup: Position of 100 SOL at $100
    // Add stop-loss at $95
    // Simulate price drop to $94
    // Verify: Full position sold at $94
}
```

### 2. Trailing Stop-Loss Test
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_trailing_stop_loss() {
    // Setup: Position at $100, 5% trailing stop
    // Simulate: Price rises to $110 (stop moves to $104.50)
    // Simulate: Price drops to $104
    // Verify: Position sold at $104
}
```

### 3. Partial Take-Profit Test
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_partial_take_profit() {
    // Setup: 100 SOL position, 50% take-profit at $110
    // Simulate: Price reaches $110
    // Verify: 50 SOL sold, 50 SOL remains
}
```

### 4. Performance Under Load Test
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_performance_under_load() {
    // Setup: 100 positions with 3 orders each
    // Run: Monitor for 1000 cycles
    // Verify: Average cycle time <50ms
    // Verify: No cycles >100ms
}
```

### 5. Concurrent Order Test
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_concurrent_orders() {
    // Setup: Multiple orders on same position
    // Trigger: Multiple conditions simultaneously
    // Verify: All orders execute correctly
    // Verify: No race conditions
}
```

### 6. Error Recovery Test
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_error_recovery() {
    // Setup: Normal monitoring
    // Simulate: Trade execution failure
    // Verify: Monitoring continues
    // Verify: Error logged appropriately
}
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### 1. Performance Metrics
- [ ] Monitoring cycle time histogram available
- [ ] Order execution success rate tracked
- [ ] Price cache hit rate monitored
- [ ] CPU and memory usage recorded

### 2. Alerts
- [ ] Alert when monitoring cycle exceeds 100ms
- [ ] Alert on repeated trade execution failures
- [ ] Alert when price data is stale
- [ ] Alert on abnormal order volume

## Edge Cases

### 1. Market Gaps
- [ ] Handles price gaps correctly (triggers at first available price)
- [ ] Large gaps don't cause calculation errors
- [ ] Trailing stops handle gaps appropriately

### 2. Precision
- [ ] Very small price movements tracked accurately
- [ ] Decimal precision maintained throughout calculations
- [ ] No floating-point errors in comparisons

### 3. Boundary Conditions
- [ ] Zero position size handled gracefully
- [ ] Negative prices rejected
- [ ] Extreme percentages (0%, 100%) work correctly
