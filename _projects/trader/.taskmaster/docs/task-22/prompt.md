# Task 22: Implement Comprehensive Testing Framework - Autonomous Prompt

You are tasked with creating a comprehensive testing framework for a Solana trading bot system. This framework must ensure reliability, validate performance targets, and verify that paper trading correlates 85-90% with live trading results.

## Context

The trading system consists of multiple components including trade engines, database layers (PostgreSQL, QuestDB, Redis), external API integrations (Jupiter, Solana), and monitoring infrastructure. The testing framework must validate all components individually and as an integrated system.

## Current State

The following components need testing coverage:
- Common trading libraries (models, utilities)
- Database integrations (PostgreSQL, QuestDB, Redis)
- Paper trader and virtual portfolio manager
- External API clients (Solana gRPC, Jupiter REST)
- Circuit breaker and failover mechanisms
- MEV simulation and protection features

## Requirements

### 1. Unit Testing Framework
Create a standardized unit testing structure that:
- Uses Rust's built-in `#[test]` and `#[tokio::test]` attributes
- Provides shared test fixtures for common data (tokens, trades, configurations)
- Implements property-based testing with `proptest` for complex logic
- Includes custom assertion helpers for domain-specific validations
- Ensures every public module has corresponding tests

### 2. Mock Implementations
Build comprehensive mocks for external dependencies:
- `MockSolanaClient` - Simulates blockchain interactions with configurable latency/errors
- `MockJupiterClient` - Provides quote/swap responses with failover behavior
- `MockRedisClient` - In-memory cache implementation for testing
- Mock database connections that don't require external services
- Configurable failure modes for resilience testing

### 3. Integration Testing
Implement integration tests using real services:
- Use `testcontainers` for PostgreSQL, Redis, and QuestDB
- Create test environment setup/teardown utilities
- Run database migrations as part of test setup
- Validate data flows across all three databases
- Test transaction boundaries and rollback scenarios

### 4. Performance Benchmarks
Create benchmarks that validate performance requirements:
- Redis cache reads must complete in <1ms
- QuestDB batch writes must handle 100ms intervals
- Circuit breaker latency calculation at 200ms P99
- Jupiter failover must occur within 250ms
- Use `criterion` crate for statistical analysis

### 5. Correlation Testing
Build framework to compare paper vs live trading:
- Track execution prices, slippage, and latency
- Calculate correlation coefficients
- Validate 85-90% correlation target
- Generate detailed correlation reports
- Test under various market conditions

### 6. MEV Simulation Validation
Verify MEV simulation accuracy:
- Compare predictions against historical data
- Validate sandwich attack detection rates
- Test MEV protection effectiveness
- Ensure 15-20% attack probability for memecoins

### 7. Load Testing
Implement stress tests for system limits:
- Concurrent trade execution
- Circuit breaker behavior under load
- Database connection pooling
- API rate limit handling
- System stability over extended periods

### 8. Test Utilities
Create helpers for test data and cleanup:
- Realistic trade data generators
- Price series simulators with configurable volatility
- Order book generators
- Database reset utilities
- Redis cache clearing functions

### 9. CI/CD Integration
Set up automated testing pipeline:
- GitHub Actions workflow configuration
- Parallel test execution where possible
- Coverage reporting with codecov.io
- Performance regression detection
- Benchmark result tracking

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
```toml
[dev-dependencies]
mockall = "0.12"
proptest = "1.4"
criterion = { version = "0.5", features = ["async_tokio"] }
testcontainers = "0.15"
approx = "0.5"
statistical = "1.0"
rand = "0.8"
tokio-test = "0.4"
serial_test = "3.0"
```

### Test Organization
```
tests/
├── common/mod.rs         # Shared utilities
├── unit/                 # Unit tests
├── integration/          # Integration tests
├── correlation/          # Correlation tests
├── mev/                  # MEV validation
├── load/                 # Load tests
└── generators/           # Data generators

benches/                  # Performance benchmarks
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Start with Test Utilities**: Build common fixtures and helpers first
2. **Mock External Services**: Create configurable mocks before integration tests
3. **Property-Based Tests**: Use for complex calculations and edge cases
4. **Benchmark Critical Paths**: Focus on Redis, QuestDB, and failover timing
5. **Correlation Framework**: Build comparison tools for paper/live trades
6. **CI/CD Setup**: Ensure all tests run automatically on commits

## Example Test Patterns

```rust
// Unit test with mocks
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_trade_execution_with_mock() {
    let mut mock_client = MockSolanaClient::new();
    mock_client.expect_submit_transaction()
        .returning(|_| Ok(Signature::new_unique()));
    
    let executor = TradeExecutor::new(Arc::new(mock_client));
    let result = executor.execute_swap(test_params()).await;
    
    assert!(result.is_ok());
}

// Integration test with containers
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_full_trade_flow() {
    let env = TestEnvironment::new().await.unwrap();
    // Test with real databases
}

// Performance benchmark
fn bench_redis_cache(c: &mut Criterion) {
    // Benchmark cache performance
}

// Property test
proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn test_slippage_calculation(
        price in arb_price(),
        amount in arb_amount(),
        slippage_bps in arb_slippage_bps()
    ) {
        // Test with generated values
    }
}
```

## Success Criteria

The testing framework is complete when:
1. All modules have >80% test coverage
2. Mock implementations simulate all external services
3. Integration tests run with containerized databases
4. Performance benchmarks validate all targets
5. Correlation tests confirm 85-90% accuracy
6. MEV simulation validation shows >80% detection rate
7. Load tests prove system stability
8. CI/CD pipeline runs all tests automatically
9. Test utilities simplify writing new tests

## Additional Considerations

- Use `serial_test` for tests that can't run in parallel
- Implement test categorization (unit, integration, slow)
- Add fuzzing for security-critical components
- Create visual test reports for stakeholders
- Document testing best practices for the team
- Consider snapshot testing for complex outputs
- Implement contract testing for API boundaries
