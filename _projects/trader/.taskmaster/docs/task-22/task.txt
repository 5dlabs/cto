# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing Framework for All Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 15, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive testing framework that covers unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks for all trading system components to ensure reliability and validate the 85-90% correlation target.
# Details:
1. Implement unit testing framework:
   - Set up a standardized unit testing structure using Rust's built-in testing framework
   - Create test utilities for common operations (mocking, fixtures, assertions)
   - Implement property-based testing using the `proptest` crate for complex logic
   - Ensure all Rust modules have corresponding test modules

2. Implement integration testing framework:
   - Create Docker-based test environment for database integration tests
   - Implement mock implementations for all external dependencies:
     ```rust
     pub trait SolanaClient: Send + Sync + 'static {
         async fn get_account(&self, pubkey: &Pubkey) -> Result<Account, ClientError>;
         async fn submit_transaction(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Result<Signature, ClientError>;
         // Additional methods...
     }
     
     pub struct MockSolanaClient {
         // Mock state...
     }
     
     impl SolanaClient for MockSolanaClient {
         // Mock implementations...
     }
     ```
   - Create test fixtures for database connections (PostgreSQL, QuestDB, Redis)
   - Implement API mocks for Jupiter and other external services

3. Implement performance benchmarking suite:
   - Create benchmarks for Redis price cache to verify <1ms read times
   - Implement QuestDB batch write tests to confirm 100ms interval capability
   - Create circuit breaker latency tests with 200ms P99 threshold validation
   - Implement Jupiter failover benchmarks to verify <250ms fallback time
   - Use criterion.rs for statistical analysis of performance metrics

4. Implement correlation testing framework:
   - Create tools to compare paper vs. live trading results
   - Implement statistical analysis to verify 85-90% correlation target
   - Design test scenarios that cover various market conditions

5. Implement MEV simulation validation:
   - Create test cases for sandwich attack detection
   - Validate MEV probability models against historical data
   - Test MEV protection mechanisms with simulated attacks

6. Implement load testing framework:
   - Create concurrent operation tests for all critical components
   - Implement stress testing for circuit breaker and failover mechanisms
   - Test system behavior under high transaction volumes

7. Create test data generation and cleanup utilities:
   - Implement generators for realistic trade data
   - Create token price simulators with configurable volatility
   - Design cleanup routines to reset test state between runs

8. Set up continuous integration pipeline:
   - Configure GitHub Actions for automated test execution
   - Implement test coverage reporting with codecov.io
   - Create performance regression detection

9. Implement test coverage analysis:
   - Set up code coverage tools (tarpaulin for Rust)
   - Create coverage reports with branch and line metrics
   - Identify critical paths requiring additional test coverage

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify unit testing framework:
   - Confirm that all modules have corresponding test modules
   - Validate that test utilities correctly mock external dependencies
   - Verify property-based tests cover edge cases effectively
   - Run unit tests in isolation to confirm independence

2. Validate integration testing framework:
   - Test database connections with actual test instances
   - Verify mock implementations correctly simulate external behavior
   - Confirm test fixtures provide consistent test environments
   - Run integration tests against local development environment

3. Benchmark performance metrics:
   - Use criterion.rs to measure Redis cache performance under load
   - Verify QuestDB batch write performance meets 100ms interval target
   - Test circuit breaker latency calculation with simulated traffic
   - Measure Jupiter failover time under various network conditions
   - Compare results against specified performance targets

4. Test correlation framework:
   - Run identical trades in paper and live environments (with small amounts)
   - Calculate correlation coefficients for execution prices
   - Verify statistical significance of correlation results
   - Confirm correlation meets 85-90% target across different market conditions

5. Validate MEV simulation:
   - Compare simulated MEV impact against historical data
   - Test sandwich attack detection with known patterns
   - Verify protection mechanisms reduce MEV impact as expected

6. Perform load testing:
   - Run system with simulated high transaction volume
   - Measure performance degradation under load
   - Test concurrent operations with increasing thread counts
   - Verify system stability during extended load tests

7. Test CI pipeline:
   - Verify GitHub Actions correctly execute all test suites
   - Confirm coverage reports are generated accurately
   - Test performance regression detection with intentional changes

8. Analyze test coverage:
   - Verify minimum coverage thresholds (aim for >80%)
   - Identify critical paths with insufficient coverage
   - Ensure all error handling paths are tested
