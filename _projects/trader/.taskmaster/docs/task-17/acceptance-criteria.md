# Task 17: Acceptance Criteria

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Core Transaction Execution
- [ ] **Transaction Builder**:
  - Constructs valid Jupiter V6 swap transactions
  - Includes compute budget instruction with priority fee
  - Adds MEV protection parameters (wrap_sol, shared_accounts)
  - Supports both legacy and versioned transactions
  - Handles token accounts creation if needed
- [ ] **Priority Fee Calculation**:
  - Queries recent priority fees from Solana
  - Calculates percentile based on urgency level (50th-95th)
  - Clamps fees to 1000-10000 lamports range
  - Caches fee data with 10-second TTL
  - Falls back to defaults if RPC fails
- [ ] **Transaction Signing**:
  - Integrates with wallet manager for secure signing
  - Updates recent blockhash before signing
  - Completes signing operation in <10ms
  - Handles both Transaction and VersionedTransaction types

### 2. gRPC Interface
- [ ] **Service Implementation**:
  - `execute_trade_request()` accepts TradeRequest objects
  - Returns detailed TradeResult with all metrics
  - `get_executor_status()` returns health status
  - Proper error mapping to gRPC status codes
- [ ] **Request Validation**:
  - Validates all required fields are present
  - Checks token addresses are valid public keys
  - Ensures amount is within min/max limits
  - Validates slippage tolerance (<10%)
  - Verifies tokens are whitelisted
- [ ] **Response Format**:
  - Includes request_id for correlation
  - Provides transaction signature on success
  - Returns execution metrics (price, slippage, fees)
  - Contains detailed error message on failure
  - Reports MEV protection status

### 3. Risk Management Integration
- [ ] **Pre-trade Checks**:
  - Verifies wallet has sufficient balance for trade + fees
  - Checks circuit breaker is in open state
  - Validates token is on approved whitelist
  - Ensures trade size within configured limits
  - Estimates total fees before execution
- [ ] **Transaction Simulation**:
  - Simulates transaction before signing
  - Verifies simulation succeeds without errors
  - Checks compute units consumed
  - Validates expected token transfers
  - Aborts on simulation failure

### 4. Transaction Execution
- [ ] **Send Transaction**:
  - Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Maximum 3 retry attempts for transient errors
  - Distinguishes permanent vs temporary failures
  - Times out after 5 seconds per attempt
  - Logs all retry attempts
- [ ] **Confirmation Monitoring**:
  - Polls for transaction status asynchronously
  - Uses adaptive polling intervals (100ms → 1s)
  - Timeout after 30 seconds (configurable)
  - Extracts execution details from confirmed tx
  - Handles both success and failure confirmations
- [ ] **Execution Metrics**:
  - Records total execution time
  - Tracks confirmation time separately
  - Calculates actual vs expected slippage
  - Captures all fees paid (base + priority)
  - Logs MEV protection effectiveness

### 5. Database Recording
- [ ] **QuestDB Integration**:
  - Records all successful trades with full details
  - Includes request_id for traceability
  - Stores source_service identifier
  - Records execution and confirmation times
  - Properly handles NULL values
- [ ] **Failed Trade Recording**:
  - Logs all failed attempts with error details
  - Categorizes errors by type
  - Includes original request parameters
  - Tracks retry attempts
- [ ] **Audit Logging**:
  - PostgreSQL audit log for all requests
  - Records execution steps with timestamps
  - Stores complete request/response data
  - Maintains correlation with request_id

### 6. Error Handling
- [ ] **Error Types**:
  - Specific error for each failure mode
  - Includes contextual information
  - Implements `is_retryable()` method
  - Provides error categorization
- [ ] **Recovery Logic**:
  - Automatic retry for network errors
  - No retry for permanent failures
  - Exponential backoff between retries
  - Circuit breaker integration
- [ ] **Error Reporting**:
  - Detailed error messages in TradeResult
  - Appropriate gRPC status codes
  - Metrics tracking for error rates
  - Alerts for critical failures

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- [ ] Request processing starts within 5ms
- [ ] Transaction building completes in <50ms
- [ ] Total execution time <100ms to broadcast
- [ ] Supports 100+ concurrent requests
- [ ] Memory usage stable under load

### Reliability
- [ ] 99.9% uptime for gRPC service
- [ ] Graceful degradation on Jupiter failover
- [ ] No data loss on service restart
- [ ] Proper connection pooling
- [ ] Clean shutdown handling

### Security
- [ ] No private keys in logs or errors
- [ ] Request authentication via gRPC metadata
- [ ] Rate limiting per source service
- [ ] Input sanitization for all fields
- [ ] Audit trail for compliance

## Test Cases

### Transaction Building Tests
```rust
// Test 1: Basic swap transaction
Input: SOL→USDC swap for 1 SOL
Expected: Valid transaction with Jupiter swap instruction

// Test 2: MEV protection parameters
Input: Any swap request
Expected: wrap_sol=true, shared_accounts=true, priority_fee set

// Test 3: Versioned transaction
Input: Request with versioned tx preference
Expected: VersionedTransaction with lookup tables
```

### gRPC Service Tests
```rust
// Test 1: Valid trade request
Input: Complete TradeRequest with all fields
Expected: TradeResult with success status

// Test 2: Invalid token address
Input: TradeRequest with malformed token
Expected: INVALID_ARGUMENT status code

// Test 3: Circuit breaker closed
Input: Any request when breaker is closed
Expected: UNAVAILABLE status code
```

### Risk Validation Tests
```rust
// Test 1: Insufficient balance
Setup: Wallet with 0.5 SOL
Input: Trade for 1 SOL
Expected: InsufficientBalance error

// Test 2: Token not whitelisted
Input: Trade with unknown token
Expected: TokenNotWhitelisted error

// Test 3: Trade size too large
Input: Trade exceeding max_trade_size
Expected: AmountTooLarge error
```

### Confirmation Tests
```rust
// Test 1: Quick confirmation
Scenario: Transaction confirms in 2 slots
Expected: Confirmation within 5 seconds

// Test 2: Slow confirmation
Scenario: Transaction takes 20 seconds
Expected: Continues polling, eventual success

// Test 3: Transaction dropped
Scenario: Transaction never confirms
Expected: Timeout after 30 seconds
```

### Integration Tests
```rust
// Test 1: Full successful trade
Process: Request → Validate → Build → Sign → Send → Confirm → Record
Expected: Complete execution in <5 seconds

// Test 2: Retry on network error
Scenario: First send attempt fails
Expected: Retries and succeeds on 2nd attempt

// Test 3: Concurrent requests
Input: 10 simultaneous trade requests
Expected: All process independently without blocking
```
