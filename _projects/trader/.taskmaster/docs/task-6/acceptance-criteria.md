# Task 6: Acceptance Criteria

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Circuit Breaker State Machine
- [ ] **Three States Implemented**:
  - Closed: Normal operation, requests allowed
  - Open: Circuit broken, requests blocked
  - Half-Open: Testing recovery, limited requests
- [ ] **State Transitions**:
  - Closed → Open: After 5 failures or P99 > 200ms
  - Open → Half-Open: After 30s recovery timeout
  - Half-Open → Closed: On successful request
  - Half-Open → Open: On any failure
- [ ] **Thread Safety**:
  - All state changes are atomic
  - No race conditions
  - Concurrent access handled
  - RwLock for state management
- [ ] **State Listeners**:
  - Register multiple listeners
  - Async notifications on change
  - No blocking in callbacks
  - Error handling in listeners

### 2. Latency Monitoring
- [ ] **Rolling Window**:
  - Maintains 1000 samples
  - FIFO eviction policy
  - Memory bounded
  - Thread-safe access
- [ ] **P99 Calculation**:
  - Accurate percentile algorithm
  - Real-time updates
  - Efficient sorting
  - Handles empty window
- [ ] **Threshold Detection**:
  - Triggers at 200ms P99
  - Records failure on breach
  - Updates circuit state
  - Logs threshold violations
- [ ] **Statistics Export**:
  - Mean, min, max, P50, P95, P99
  - Sample count
  - Accessible via API
  - JSON serializable

### 3. Recovery Mechanism
- [ ] **Exponential Backoff**:
  - Base delay: 1 second
  - Multiplier: 2.0
  - Max delay: 5 minutes
  - Retry count tracking
- [ ] **Jitter**:
  - 10% random jitter
  - Prevents thundering herd
  - Applied to calculated delay
  - Uniform distribution
- [ ] **Health Checks**:
  - Async health checker trait
  - Configurable check operation
  - Success/failure reporting
  - Latency measurement
- [ ] **Recovery Loop**:
  - Runs continuously
  - Checks circuit state
  - Initiates health checks
  - Resets on success

### 4. Trading Integration
- [ ] **Operation Wrapper**:
  - `execute_with_breaker()` method
  - Checks circuit before execution
  - Records latency after
  - Handles failures
- [ ] **Error Types**:
  - CircuitOpen error
  - OperationFailed with cause
  - Proper error propagation
  - Debug information
- [ ] **Metrics Collection**:
  - Total requests
  - Blocked requests
  - Success/failure counts
  - State change count
- [ ] **Performance**:
  - <100μs overhead
  - No blocking on check
  - Efficient latency recording
  - Minimal memory usage

## Test Cases

### State Machine Tests
```rust
// Test 1: Basic state transitions
- Start in Closed state
- Record 5 failures
- Verify Open state
- Wait 30 seconds
- Verify Half-Open state
- Record success
- Verify Closed state

// Test 2: Half-Open failure
- Transition to Half-Open
- Record failure
- Verify immediate Open state
- No additional requests allowed

// Test 3: Concurrent operations
- 100 threads recording outcomes
- Verify consistent state
- No race conditions
- Correct final state
```

### Latency Tests
```rust
// Test 1: P99 calculation
Input: 1000 samples from 1-1000ms
Expected: P99 = 990ms

// Test 2: Threshold trigger
Input: 100 samples, 10 at 250ms
Expected: P99 > 200ms, circuit opens

// Test 3: Window eviction
Input: 1500 samples
Expected: Only last 1000 retained
```

### Recovery Tests
```rust
// Test 1: Backoff progression
Retries: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
Expected: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s

// Test 2: Max delay cap
Retries: 10
Expected: 300s (5 min max)

// Test 3: Jitter application
Input: Base 10s, jitter 0.1
Expected: 9s - 11s range
```

### Integration Tests
```rust
// Test 1: Normal operation
- Execute 100 operations
- All succeed with <200ms
- Circuit remains closed
- No blocked requests

// Test 2: Latency spike
- Normal operations
- Inject 300ms latencies
- Circuit opens after threshold
- Subsequent requests blocked

// Test 3: Recovery flow
- Circuit in open state
- Health check succeeds
- Circuit transitions to half-open
- Successful request closes circuit
```

## Load Tests

### Sustained Load
```rust
// 1000 operations/second for 60 seconds
- P99 tracking accurate
- State transitions correct
- Memory usage stable
- No performance degradation
```

### Burst Scenarios
```rust
// 10,000 operations in 1 second
- Circuit breaker handles load
- Correct state management
- No deadlocks
- Metrics accurate
```
