- [ ] No real transactions submitted
- [ ] Simulated latency realistic
- [ ] MEV simulation works
- [ ] Results match paper trader behavior

### 11. Live Trading Execution
- [ ] Live trades route to live executor
- [ ] Additional permission check passes
- [ ] Real transactions submitted
- [ ] MEV protection applied
- [ ] Circuit breaker checked
- [ ] Risk limits enforced

### 12. Error Handling
- [ ] Validation errors return INVALID_ARGUMENT
- [ ] Auth failures return UNAUTHENTICATED
- [ ] Permission errors return PERMISSION_DENIED
- [ ] Insufficient funds return FAILED_PRECONDITION
- [ ] Circuit breaker returns UNAVAILABLE
- [ ] Slippage errors return ABORTED
- [ ] Timeouts return DEADLINE_EXCEEDED
- [ ] Internal errors return INTERNAL

## Monitoring & Observability

### 13. Request Logging
- [ ] All requests logged with timestamp
- [ ] Request ID included in logs
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged
- [ ] Response logged with result
- [ ] Latency recorded
- [ ] Logs written to QuestDB

### 14. Metrics Collection
- [ ] Total request count tracked
- [ ] Request count by mode (paper/live)
- [ ] Failure count tracked
- [ ] Latency histogram updated
- [ ] Active requests gauge accurate
- [ ] Metrics exposed for Prometheus

### 15. Audit Trail
- [ ] All trades recorded in audit log
- [ ] User identity captured
- [ ] Timestamp accurate
- [ ] Success/failure recorded
- [ ] Audit logs immutable
- [ ] Queryable by request ID

## Performance Requirements

### 16. Latency Targets
- [ ] Unary calls complete <50ms (P99)
- [ ] Stream initiation <10ms
- [ ] Status updates <5ms each
- [ ] Health check <10ms
- [ ] History query <100ms for 1000 records

### 17. Throughput
- [ ] Handles 1000 requests/second
- [ ] Supports 100 concurrent streams
- [ ] No memory leaks under load
- [ ] CPU usage scales linearly
- [ ] Connection pooling works

### 18. Resource Management
- [ ] Graceful shutdown implemented
- [ ] In-flight requests tracked
- [ ] Shutdown waits for completion
- [ ] Timeouts on shutdown (30s max)
- [ ] Resources cleaned up
- [ ] No goroutine/task leaks

## Integration Testing

### 19. End-to-End Tests

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_paper_trade_execution() {
    // Setup server and client
    // Execute paper trade
    // Verify result
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_live_trade_authorization() {
    // Attempt live trade without permission
    // Verify permission denied
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_streaming_updates() {
    // Start stream
    // Collect all updates
    // Verify completion
}
```

### 20. Load Testing
