# Task 24: Implement gRPC Trade Execution Service Interface - Autonomous Prompt

You are tasked with implementing a gRPC service that serves as the interface between external trading decision services and the Solana trading platform's execution engines. This service must handle trade requests, route them to the appropriate executor (paper or live), provide real-time status updates, and maintain comprehensive audit trails.

## Context

The trading platform has both paper and live trade executors already implemented. External systems need a standardized, high-performance way to submit trades and monitor their execution. The gRPC service will provide this interface, supporting both unary calls for simple trades and streaming for real-time status updates.

## Current State

You have access to:
- Paper Trade Executor (from previous tasks) - Simulates trades
- Live Trade Executor (Task 17) - Executes real trades with MEV protection
- gRPC infrastructure patterns (Task 9) - Base gRPC client implementation
- Monitoring infrastructure (Task 18) - Metrics and logging capabilities

## Requirements

### 1. Protocol Buffer Definitions
Create comprehensive protobuf definitions that include:
- `TradeRequest` message with all necessary trading parameters
- `TradeResult` message with execution details
- `ExecutionStatus` for streaming updates
- Trading mode enum (PAPER/LIVE)
- MEV protection parameters
- History and position query messages
- Health check endpoints

### 2. Service Implementation
Implement the `TradeExecutionService` with these RPC methods:
- `ExecuteTrade` - Unary call for single trade execution
- `StreamExecutionStatus` - Server streaming for real-time updates
- `GetTradeHistory` - Query historical trades
- `GetPositions` - Get current positions
- `HealthCheck` - Service health status

### 3. Request Validation
Build a validation layer that:
- Validates token addresses are valid Solana pubkeys
- Checks amount format and ranges
- Validates slippage tolerance (0-100%)
- Ensures request IDs are unique
- Validates MEV protection parameters
- Checks supported token pairs

### 4. Authentication & Authorization
Implement security features:
- Validate auth tokens on all requests
- Check permissions for live trading
- Separate permissions for paper vs live
- Rate limiting per user
- Audit all authentication attempts

### 5. Execution Routing
Create routing logic that:
- Directs requests to paper or live executor based on mode
- Applies additional safety checks for live trading
- Handles executor failures gracefully
- Supports request cancellation
- Manages in-flight request tracking

### 6. Real-time Status Streaming
Implement streaming capabilities:
- Send status updates during trade execution
- Include percentage completion
- Provide detailed status messages
- Handle client disconnections
- Clean up resources on stream close

### 7. Error Handling
Map execution errors to appropriate gRPC status codes:
- `INVALID_ARGUMENT` for validation failures
- `UNAUTHENTICATED` for auth failures
- `PERMISSION_DENIED` for unauthorized operations
- `FAILED_PRECONDITION` for insufficient funds
- `UNAVAILABLE` for circuit breaker open
- `ABORTED` for excessive slippage
- `INTERNAL` for unexpected errors

### 8. Logging & Monitoring
Implement comprehensive observability:
- Log all requests with request IDs
- Record responses and execution times
- Track metrics (request count, latency, failures)
- Store audit trail in QuestDB
- Support correlation IDs for tracing

### 9. Performance Optimization
Ensure high performance:
- Connection pooling for executors
- Efficient protobuf serialization
- Concurrent request handling
- Request buffering and batching
- Caching for frequent queries

### 10. Graceful Shutdown
Handle shutdown properly:
- Track in-flight requests
- Wait for completion or timeout
- Notify clients of shutdown
- Save state if needed
- Clean up resources

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
```toml
[dependencies]
tonic = "0.10"
prost = "0.12"
tokio = { version = "1.35", features = ["full"] }
tokio-stream = "0.1"
tower = "0.4"
tower-http = { version = "0.5", features = ["trace"] }
futures = "0.3"
prometheus = "0.13"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
anyhow = "1.0"
thiserror = "1.0"

[build-dependencies]
tonic-build = "0.10"
```

### Proto Build Configuration
```rust
// build.rs
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    tonic_build::configure()
        .build_server(true)
        .build_client(true)
        .compile(&["proto/trade_execution.proto"], &["proto"])?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Start with Proto**: Define complete protocol buffers first
2. **Implement Validation**: Build request validator with comprehensive checks
3. **Create Service Stub**: Implement basic service structure
4. **Add Authentication**: Integrate auth checks on all methods
5. **Implement Routing**: Route to appropriate executors
6. **Add Streaming**: Implement status streaming
7. **Error Handling**: Map all errors to gRPC codes
8. **Add Monitoring**: Integrate metrics and logging
9. **Test Thoroughly**: Unit and integration tests

## Example Implementation Pattern

```rust
#[tonic::async_trait]
impl TradeExecutionService for TradeExecutionServiceImpl {
    async fn execute_trade(
        &self,
        request: Request<TradeRequest>,
    ) -> Result<Response<TradeResult>, Status> {
        // Extract request
        let trade_request = request.into_inner();
        
        // Validate auth
        self.auth_service.validate(&trade_request.auth_token).await?;
        
        // Validate request
        self.validator.validate(&trade_request)?;
        
        // Route to executor
        let result = match trade_request.mode() {
            TradingMode::Paper => self.paper_executor.execute(trade_request).await,
            TradingMode::Live => self.live_executor.execute(trade_request).await,
        };
        
        // Map result
        result.map(|r| Response::new(convert_to_proto(r)))
            .map_err(map_execution_error)
    }
}
```

## Success Criteria

The gRPC service is complete when:
1. All proto definitions compile without errors
2. Service handles both paper and live trades
3. Authentication works on all endpoints
4. Streaming provides real-time updates
5. Errors map to appropriate status codes
6. Metrics track performance accurately
7. Graceful shutdown works properly
8. Integration tests pass
9. Load tests show <50ms latency
10. Documentation is complete

## Additional Considerations

- Support batch trade requests for efficiency
- Implement request deduplication
- Add circuit breaker integration
- Support different auth mechanisms (JWT, API keys)
- Consider implementing bidirectional streaming
- Add OpenTelemetry tracing support
- Implement request retry logic
- Support webhook notifications for trade completion
