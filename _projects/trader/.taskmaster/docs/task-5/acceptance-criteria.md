# Task 5: Acceptance Criteria

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Redis Connection Pool
- [ ] **Pool Configuration**:
  - 20 connections maximum
  - Connection health checking enabled
  - 2-second connection timeout
  - Automatic reconnection on failure
- [ ] **Error Handling**:
  - Graceful degradation on pool exhaustion
  - Detailed error messages
  - Connection retry logic
  - Metrics for pool usage
- [ ] **Resource Management**:
  - Connections returned to pool after use
  - No connection leaks
  - Proper cleanup on shutdown
  - Pool statistics available

### 2. Price Cache Implementation
- [ ] **Cache Operations**:
  - `set_price()` stores with 2s TTL
  - `get_price()` returns in <1ms
  - `set_multiple_prices()` batch operation
  - `get_all_prices()` batch retrieval
- [ ] **Data Structure**:
  - Key format: `price:{token}`
  - JSON serialization of PriceData
  - Timestamp included
  - Source tracking (e.g., "jupiter")
- [ ] **Performance**:
  - Average read latency <1ms
  - P99 latency <2ms
  - Batch operations optimized
  - Pipeline usage where applicable
- [ ] **Token Support**:
  - SOL, USDC, BONK, JitoSOL, RAY
  - Extensible for new tokens
  - Validation of token symbols
  - Decimal precision preserved

### 3. Event Streaming
- [ ] **Stream Operations**:
  - Publish events with XADD
  - Automatic trimming at ~10,000
  - Consumer group support
  - Message acknowledgment
- [ ] **Event Types**:
  - PriceUpdate events
  - TradeExecuted events
  - PositionUpdate events
  - SystemStatus events
- [ ] **Performance**:
  - 10Hz update rate sustained
  - 100ms block timeout
  - Batch reading (100 events)
  - No message loss
- [ ] **Stream Management**:
  - Create consumer groups
  - Multiple consumers supported
  - Pending message handling
  - Stream health monitoring

### 4. Pool State Cache
- [ ] **MEV Support**:
  - Store pool liquidity data
  - Reserve amounts tracked
  - 24h volume included
  - 2-second TTL matching prices
- [ ] **Operations**:
  - `set_pool_state()` with TTL
  - `get_pool_state()` fast retrieval
  - Key format: `pool:{address}`
  - JSON serialization

### 5. Price Update Service
- [ ] **Automated Updates**:
  - Fetches prices every 500ms
  - Updates cache automatically
  - Publishes price events
  - Handles failures gracefully
- [ ] **Integration**:
  - Uses Jupiter client for prices
  - Parallel token updates
  - Batch cache updates
  - Event publishing

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- [ ] Price cache reads average <1ms
- [ ] 99th percentile reads <2ms
- [ ] Stream publishing <10ms
- [ ] No blocking operations

### Reliability
- [ ] Handles Redis downtime
- [ ] Automatic reconnection
- [ ] Circuit breaker integration
- [ ] Graceful degradation

### Scalability
- [ ] Supports 1000+ reads/second
- [ ] Handles 100+ events/second
- [ ] Connection pool scales
- [ ] Memory usage stable

## Test Cases

### Latency Tests
```rust
// Test 1: Single price read
Input: Get price for "SOL"
Expected: Latency <1ms

// Test 2: Batch price read
Input: Get 5 token prices
Expected: Total latency <5ms

// Test 3: Under load
Input: 1000 concurrent reads
Expected: Average <1ms, P99 <2ms
```

### TTL Tests
```rust
// Test 1: Price expiration
Input: Set price, wait 2.1 seconds
Expected: Price no longer available

// Test 2: Refresh extends TTL
Input: Update price before expiry
Expected: TTL reset to 2 seconds

// Test 3: Pool state TTL
Input: Set pool state, check TTL
Expected: Expires after 2 seconds
```

### Stream Tests
```rust
// Test 1: 10Hz publishing
Input: Publish 100 events at 10Hz
Expected: All received within 10.5 seconds

// Test 2: Trimming behavior
Input: Publish 15,000 events
Expected: Stream length ~10,000

// Test 3: Consumer groups
Input: 3 consumers in group
Expected: Each gets unique events
```

### Integration Tests
```rust
// Test 1: Price update flow
1. Jupiter returns price
2. Cache updated
3. Event published
4. Subscriber receives
Expected: <100ms total

// Test 2: Concurrent operations
1. 10 price updates
2. 20 cache reads
3. 5 event publishes
Expected: All complete successfully

// Test 3: Failure recovery
1. Redis goes down
2. Operations fail gracefully
3. Redis recovers
4. Operations resume
Expected: No data corruption
```

## Load Testing

### Sustained Load Test
```rust
// 24-hour test
- 1000 reads/second
- 100 writes/second
- 50 events/second
Expected:
- Memory stable
- Latency consistent
- No connection leaks
```

### Burst Load Test
```rust
// 5-minute burst
- 5000 reads/second
- 500 writes/second
- 200 events/second
Expected:
- Pool handles load
- Latency degrades gracefully
- Recovery after burst
```
