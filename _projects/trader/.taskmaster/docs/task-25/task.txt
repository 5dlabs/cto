# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement gRPC Testing Client for Trade Request Simulation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 24
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a testing client that can send trade requests to the gRPC trade execution service for development and integration testing, simulating external decision services.
# Details:
1. Implement CLI interface for the testing client:
   - Use the `clap` crate to create a command-line interface
   - Support for individual trade request submission
   - Batch mode for sending multiple requests from a file
   - Support for both synchronous and streaming requests

2. Implement trade request parameter configuration:
   - Token pair selection (support all MVP tokens: SOL, USDC, BONK, JitoSOL, RAY)
   - Trade amount specification with proper decimal handling
   - Slippage tolerance settings (0.1% to 5%)
   - Priority fee configuration for MEV protection
   - Trading mode selection (paper vs. live)
   - Request ID generation or manual specification

3. Create request template system:
   ```rust
   #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
   pub struct RequestTemplate {
       pub name: String,
       pub token_in: String,
       pub token_out: String,
       pub amount_in: f64,
       pub slippage_bps: u32,
       pub priority_fee_mode: PriorityFeeMode,
       pub trading_mode: TradingMode,
   }
   ```

4. Implement real-time execution monitoring:
   - Connect to execution status stream for real-time updates
   - Display execution progress with status indicators
   - Show final execution results with price impact and fees
   - Calculate and display execution latency metrics

5. Implement performance testing capabilities:
   - Support for concurrent request submission
   - Configurable request rate and patterns
   - Latency measurement and statistical analysis
   - Result aggregation and reporting

6. Implement error scenario testing:
   - Generate invalid requests for negative testing
   - Simulate network issues with request cancellation
   - Test timeout handling and retry mechanisms
   - Verify error response handling

7. Create configuration file support:
   ```toml
   [connection]
   endpoint = "http://localhost:50051"
   timeout_ms = 5000
   
   [default_trade]
   token_in = "USDC"
   token_out = "SOL"
   amount_in = 10.0
   slippage_bps = 50
   priority_fee_mode = "medium"
   
   [[templates]]
   name = "small_sol_buy"
   token_in = "USDC"
   token_out = "SOL"
   amount_in = 5.0
   slippage_bps = 30
   priority_fee_mode = "low"
   ```

8. Implement detailed logging and result analysis:
   - Log all requests and responses to file
   - Calculate success rates and error distributions
   - Generate latency histograms and percentiles
   - Compare results against expected outcomes

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit testing:
   - Create comprehensive tests for CLI argument parsing:
     ```rust
     #[test]
     fn test_cli_argument_parsing() {
         let matches = app().get_matches_from(vec![
             "test-client", "send", "--token-in", "USDC", "--token-out", "SOL", 
             "--amount", "10.0", "--slippage", "50"
         ]);
         let args = parse_args(&matches).unwrap();
         assert_eq!(args.token_in, "USDC");
         assert_eq!(args.token_out, "SOL");
         assert_eq!(args.amount, 10.0);
         assert_eq!(args.slippage_bps, 50);
     }
     ```
   - Test template loading and validation with valid and invalid templates
   - Test request building with various parameter combinations
   - Verify error handling with malformed inputs

2. Integration testing:
   - Test against a mock gRPC server:
     ```rust
     #[tokio::test]
     async fn test_request_submission() {
         let mock_server = MockTradeExecutionServer::new();
         let endpoint = mock_server.start();
         
         let client = TestClient::new(&format!("http://{}", endpoint));
         let request = TradeRequest::new("USDC", "SOL", 10.0, 50);
         
         let response = client.send_request(request).await.unwrap();
         assert!(response.success);
         assert_eq!(response.executed_price, 22.5);
     }
     ```
   - Test streaming response handling with simulated execution updates
   - Verify concurrent request handling with various load patterns
   - Test integration with the actual gRPC trade execution service

3. Performance testing:
   - Measure request throughput under various concurrency levels
   - Verify latency measurement accuracy with controlled delays
   - Test statistical analysis functions with known distributions
   - Benchmark client performance to ensure minimal overhead

4. Error scenario testing:
   - Test with deliberately invalid requests to verify error handling
   - Simulate network failures and verify reconnection behavior
   - Test timeout handling with slow responding servers
   - Verify proper cleanup of resources after errors
