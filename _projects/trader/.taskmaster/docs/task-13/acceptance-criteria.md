- [ ] Metrics update in real-time
- [ ] Port configuration respected
- [ ] Graceful handling of port conflicts

## Reliability Requirements

### 1. Error Recovery

- [ ] Partial initialization rolls back cleanly
- [ ] Network errors handled gracefully

### 2. Signal Handling
- [ ] Ctrl+C triggers graceful shutdown
- [ ] SIGTERM handled properly
- [ ] Shutdown completes within 30 seconds
- [ ] No data loss during shutdown
- [ ] Exit code reflects success/failure

### 3. Resource Management
- [ ] All database connections closed on exit
- [ ] Background tasks cancelled properly
- [ ] Memory freed appropriately
- [ ] File handles closed
- [ ] No zombie processes

### 4. Logging
- [ ] Log level configurable via CLI
- [ ] Logs include timestamp and level
- [ ] Errors logged with full context
- [ ] Performance metrics logged
- [ ] Log rotation configured

## Performance Requirements

### 1. Startup Time
- [ ] Application starts in <5 seconds
- [ ] Component initialization parallelized where possible
- [ ] No unnecessary blocking operations
- [ ] Progress indicated during startup

### 2. Resource Usage
- [ ] Memory usage <500MB under normal load
- [ ] CPU usage <10% when idle
- [ ] Database connection pool utilized efficiently
- [ ] No memory leaks over 24-hour run

### 3. Responsiveness
- [ ] TUI remains responsive during operations
- [ ] Shutdown begins within 1 second of signal
- [ ] Configuration changes take effect immediately
- [ ] No UI freezing during heavy load

## Integration Requirements

### 1. Database Integration
- [ ] Successfully writes trades to QuestDB
- [ ] Configuration stored in PostgreSQL
- [ ] Price data cached in Redis
- [ ] Connection pools work correctly
- [ ] Failover handling implemented

### 2. Service Coordination
- [ ] Services start in correct order
- [ ] Dependencies resolved properly
- [ ] Circular dependencies avoided
- [ ] Service failures isolated
- [ ] Health checks coordinated

### 3. Configuration Flow
- [ ] Config passed to all components
- [ ] Runtime changes supported where applicable
- [ ] Validation prevents invalid states
- [ ] Defaults cover all scenarios

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Startup Test
```bash
# Test default startup
./paper-trader

# Verify:
- Application starts successfully
- TUI displays
- All services running
- Can execute trades
```

### 2. Configuration Override Test
```bash
# Test CLI overrides
./paper-trader -c test.yaml --initial-sol 500 --slippage 1.5

# Verify:
- Config file loaded
- SOL allocation is 500
- Slippage is 1.5%
- Other values from file
```

### 3. Headless Operation Test
```bash
# Test headless mode
./paper-trader --no-tui --metrics-port 9191

# Verify:
- No TUI displayed
- Services still running
- Metrics available on port 9191
- Shutdown works via signal
```

### 4. Error Handling Test
```bash
# Test with invalid config
./paper-trader -c invalid.yaml

# Verify:
- Clear error message
- Suggests valid format
- No partial initialization
- Clean exit
```

### 5. Signal Handling Test
```bash
# Start application
./paper-trader

# Send SIGINT (Ctrl+C)

# Verify:
- Shutdown message appears
- Services stop gracefully
- Data flushed to databases
- Exit code is 0
```

### 6. Resource Limit Test
```bash
# Run for extended period
./paper-trader --no-tui

# Monitor for 1 hour:
- Memory usage stable
- No file descriptor leaks
- CPU usage reasonable
- Logs rotating properly
```

## Edge Cases

### 1. Missing Dependencies

- [ ] Deal with port binding failures
- [ ] File system permission errors

### 3. Resource Exhaustion
- [ ] Handle out of memory gracefully
- [ ] Deal with disk full scenarios
- [ ] Connection pool exhaustion

### 4. Configuration Conflicts
- [ ] Detect incompatible settings
