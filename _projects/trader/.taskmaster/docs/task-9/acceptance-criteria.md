# Task 9: Paper Trade Executor - Acceptance Criteria

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Trade Request Processing
- [ ] Accepts TradeRequest objects via gRPC interface
- [ ] Validates all required fields are present and valid
- [ ] Processes requests with unique request_id for traceability
- [ ] Returns comprehensive TradeResult with all specified fields
- [ ] Handles all TradeAction types (Buy, Sell, Swap)

### 2. Request Validation
- [ ] Rejects trades with zero or negative amounts
- [ ] Rejects trades with empty token symbols
- [ ] Rejects trades where base_token equals quote_token
- [ ] Validates priority fee is within reasonable bounds (<1M lamports)
- [ ] Validates slippage tolerance is <50% when provided
- [ ] Returns clear error messages for validation failures

### 3. Price Discovery
- [ ] Checks Redis cache first with 2-second TTL
- [ ] Falls back to Jupiter client on cache miss
- [ ] Caches fresh prices after Jupiter lookup
- [ ] Tracks cache hit rate in metrics
- [ ] Handles both tokens in a single price discovery operation
- [ ] Completes price lookups in <10ms with cache hit

### 4. Slippage Model Application
- [ ] Fixed slippage model applies configured percentage (0.5-2%)
- [ ] Request-level slippage override takes precedence
- [ ] Slippage applied correctly based on trade direction:
  - Buy: increases price
  - Sell: decreases price
  - Swap: depends on input token
- [ ] Dynamic slippage framework is extensible for future use
- [ ] Warnings generated for high calculated slippage (>5%)

### 5. MEV Simulation Integration
- [ ] MEV simulation only runs when request.simulate_mev is true
- [ ] Correctly calculates trade size in USD for simulation
- [ ] Applies MEV impact when attack simulated and protection insufficient
- [ ] Generates warning when MEV attack impacts price
- [ ] MEV status correctly set in trade record (Protected/AtRisk/NoAttack)
- [ ] Handles MEV simulator errors gracefully

### 6. Portfolio Updates
- [ ] Portfolio updates are atomic and thread-safe
- [ ] Trade amounts calculated correctly for base/quote
- [ ] Portfolio state reflects trade immediately after execution
- [ ] Transfer fees calculated for Token-2022 tokens
- [ ] Portfolio summary returned with current balances and P&L

### 7. Trade Recording
- [ ] All trades recorded in QuestDB asynchronously
- [ ] Trade records include all Enhanced Trade Model fields
- [ ] QuestDB write failures don't fail the trade
- [ ] Execution time measured and recorded accurately
- [ ] Metadata from request preserved in trade record

## Performance Requirements

### 1. Latency Targets
- [ ] End-to-end trade execution <100ms (excluding MEV simulation)
- [ ] Price cache lookups complete in <1ms
- [ ] Portfolio updates complete in <10ms
- [ ] MEV simulation adds <5ms when enabled
- [ ] Jupiter price fetch <200ms with failover

### 2. Throughput
- [ ] Supports 1000+ concurrent trade executions
- [ ] No performance degradation under load
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during sustained operation
- [ ] CPU usage scales linearly with request rate

### 3. Cache Performance
- [ ] Achieves >80% cache hit rate in steady state
- [ ] Cache operations non-blocking
- [ ] TTL correctly enforced (2 seconds)
- [ ] Concurrent cache access handled efficiently

## Accuracy Requirements

### 1. Price Calculations
- [ ] Expected price calculation matches Jupiter quotes within 0.1%
- [ ] Slippage applied with correct mathematical precision
- [ ] Price impact calculated accurately in basis points
- [ ] No floating-point precision errors with Decimal type

### 2. Trade Execution
- [ ] Base and quote amounts balance correctly
- [ ] Fees deducted from appropriate token
- [ ] Slippage direction matches trade action
- [ ] MEV impact realistic when simulated

### 3. Metrics Accuracy
- [ ] Execution time includes all operations
- [ ] Slippage basis points calculated correctly
- [ ] Price impact matches actual vs expected
- [ ] Cache hit rate tracks actual cache usage

## Integration Requirements

### 1. Component Integration
- [ ] Integrates with VirtualPortfolio via Arc<RwLock>
- [ ] Uses PriceCache trait for Redis integration
- [ ] Calls MevSimulator with correct parameters
- [ ] Uses JupiterClientWithFailover for price discovery
- [ ] Records to QuestDB using batch writer

### 2. Interface Compatibility
- [ ] Implements same interface as future live trader
- [ ] TradeRequest format matches external API spec
- [ ] TradeResult provides all needed information
- [ ] Error types consistent across system

### 3. Configuration
- [ ] Slippage model configurable at runtime
- [ ] Execution parameters adjustable
- [ ] MEV simulation can be enabled/disabled
- [ ] Cache TTL configurable

## Error Handling

### 1. Graceful Failures
- [ ] Invalid requests return error without side effects
- [ ] Network failures trigger retry logic
- [ ] Partial failures rolled back cleanly
- [ ] All errors return actionable messages

### 2. Resilience
- [ ] Continues operation if QuestDB unavailable
- [ ] Falls back to Jupiter if cache unavailable
- [ ] Handles MEV simulator failures gracefully
- [ ] No panics under any input conditions

### 3. Logging
- [ ] All trades logged with request_id
- [ ] Warnings logged for unusual conditions
- [ ] Errors include full context
- [ ] Performance metrics logged periodically

## Test Coverage

### 1. Unit Tests
- [ ] Request validation with valid/invalid inputs
- [ ] Slippage calculations for all trade types
- [ ] Price calculation accuracy
- [ ] MEV integration scenarios
- [ ] Error handling paths

### 2. Integration Tests
- [ ] Full trade flow with real components
- [ ] Concurrent execution stress test
- [ ] Cache hit/miss scenarios
- [ ] Failover behavior verification
- [ ] Portfolio consistency checks

### 3. Performance Tests
- [ ] Latency benchmarks for each operation
- [ ] Load testing with 1000+ concurrent trades
- [ ] Memory leak detection
- [ ] Cache efficiency measurement

## Acceptance Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Buy Trade
```
Given: TradeRequest to buy 10 SOL with USDC
When: Executor processes request with 1% fixed slippage
Then:
  - SOL balance increases by ~10 (minus fees)
  - USDC balance decreases by amount at market price +1%
  - Execution completes in <100ms
  - Trade recorded in QuestDB
```

### Scenario 2: MEV-Affected Sell
```
Given: TradeRequest to sell 1000 BONK with MEV simulation
When: MEV simulator indicates attack with 150bps impact
Then:
  - Execution price reduced by 150bps from slippage price
  - Warning added about MEV attack
  - Trade marked as AtRisk in record
  - Recommended fee shown in warning
```

### Scenario 3: High-Volume Concurrent Trades
```
Given: 100 simultaneous trade requests
When: All requests processed concurrently
Then:
  - All trades complete successfully
  - No race conditions in portfolio updates
  - Average latency stays <100ms
  - Cache hit rate >80%
```

### Scenario 4: Price Cache Performance
```
Given: Repeated trades for same token pair
When: 10 trades executed within 2 seconds
Then:
  - First trade fetches from Jupiter
  - Subsequent 9 trades use cached price
  - Cache lookups complete in <1ms
  - Cache expires after 2 seconds
```

### Scenario 5: Error Recovery
```
Given: Trade request with invalid token "INVALID"
When: Executor attempts to process
Then:
  - Validation or price fetch fails
  - Clear error returned
  - No portfolio changes
  - No QuestDB record created
```
