# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Enhanced Wallet Manager for Live Trading
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a secure wallet management system for live trading that handles encrypted keypair storage, secure transaction signing, and key rotation with high security standards.
# Details:
1. Implement encrypted keypair storage:
   - Use the `ring` crate for encryption/decryption of keypairs
   - Create a secure file format for storing encrypted keys
   - Implement password-based key derivation function (PBKDF2) with sufficient iterations
   - Support multiple wallets with unique identifiers

2. Implement secure memory management:
   - Use the `secrecy` crate to prevent key material from being printed or logged
   - Implement memory zeroization after key usage to prevent leakage
   - Create wrapper types that automatically clear sensitive data when dropped
   - Minimize the time private keys exist in memory

3. Implement key rotation functionality:
   - Support scheduled key rotation (daily as specified)
   - Create secure key migration process
   - Maintain transaction continuity during rotation
   - Implement rotation verification and rollback capabilities

4. Implement transaction signing:
   - Create secure transaction signing methods that minimize key exposure
   - Integrate with Solana transaction types from the common libraries
   - Implement recent blockhash management for transaction validity
   - Add proper error handling for signing failures

5. Implement security measures:
   - Add audit logging for all wallet operations
   - Implement rate limiting for failed decryption attempts
   - Create key backup and recovery mechanisms
   - Add tamper detection for stored wallet files

6. Create wallet manager API:
   - Design a clean API that hides implementation details
   - Implement proper error types and handling
   - Create builder pattern for wallet configuration
   - Add documentation and usage examples

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit testing:
   - Create tests for encryption/decryption with known test vectors
   - Test memory zeroization by examining memory patterns after operations
   - Verify key rotation functionality with simulated schedule
   - Test transaction signing with various transaction types
   - Verify error handling for all edge cases

2. Security testing:
   - Perform static analysis using cargo-audit to check for vulnerabilities
   - Use memory analysis tools to verify no key material remains after operations
   - Test against timing attacks by measuring operation time variance
   - Verify resistance to brute force attacks on encrypted storage

3. Integration testing:
   - Test integration with Solana transaction types from common libraries
   - Verify transaction signing with a local Solana validator
   - Test key rotation during active operations
   - Verify blockhash management with simulated network conditions

4. Stress testing:
   - Test performance under high transaction volume
   - Verify memory usage remains constant during extended operation
   - Test concurrent access patterns with multiple threads
   - Measure and optimize critical path performance

5. Compliance verification:
   - Review implementation against security best practices
   - Verify all security requirements are met
   - Document security properties and limitations
