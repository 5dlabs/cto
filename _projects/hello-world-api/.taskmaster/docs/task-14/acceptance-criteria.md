# Task 14 Acceptance Criteria: Manual Testing of API Endpoints

## Test Preparation

- [ ] API server is running successfully
- [ ] Testing tools are ready (curl, Postman, or browser)
- [ ] Test documentation template is prepared

## Root Endpoint (GET /) Testing

- [ ] GET request to / returns 200 status code
- [ ] Response body contains `{"message": "Hello, World!"}`
- [ ] Content-Type header is `application/json`
- [ ] Response time is reasonable (< 200ms)
- [ ] Non-GET methods (POST, PUT, DELETE) are properly rejected
- [ ] No errors appear in server console

## Health Check Endpoint (GET /health) Testing

- [ ] GET request to /health returns 200 status code
- [ ] Response contains `status` field with value "healthy"
- [ ] Response contains `timestamp` field
- [ ] Timestamp is in valid ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ)
- [ ] Multiple requests show different timestamps
- [ ] Content-Type header is `application/json`
- [ ] Response time is reasonable (< 200ms)

## Error Handling Testing

### 404 Not Found Testing
- [ ] Request to /nonexistent returns 404 status code
- [ ] Error response has consistent JSON format
- [ ] Error message is appropriate (e.g., "Not Found")
- [ ] Multiple invalid routes all return 404
- [ ] Error response structure matches documentation

### Server Error Testing (if applicable)
- [ ] Any 500 errors return appropriate error response
- [ ] Error details are not exposed in production mode
- [ ] Errors are properly logged to console

## Request Logging Verification

- [ ] All requests are logged to console
- [ ] Log entries include timestamp
- [ ] Log entries include HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
- [ ] Log entries include request path
- [ ] Log format is consistent across all requests
- [ ] No sensitive data is logged

## Cross-Browser/Tool Testing

- [ ] API works correctly when accessed via curl
- [ ] API works correctly when accessed via Postman
- [ ] API works correctly when accessed via web browser
- [ ] JSON responses are properly formatted in all tools

## Performance Testing

- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Endpoints respond within acceptable time (< 200ms)
- [ ] Server remains stable during testing
- [ ] No memory leaks observed during testing
- [ ] Console doesn't show unexpected warnings

## Test Documentation

- [ ] Test results are documented for each endpoint
- [ ] Screenshots/evidence captured for key tests
- [ ] Any issues found are clearly documented
- [ ] Test execution date and time recorded
- [ ] Test environment details noted

## Postman Collection (if created)

- [ ] Collection includes all endpoints
- [ ] Requests are properly organized
- [ ] Expected responses are saved
- [ ] Collection can be exported and shared
- [ ] Basic tests/assertions added to requests

## Issue Tracking
