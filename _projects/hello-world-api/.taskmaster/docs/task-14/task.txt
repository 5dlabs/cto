# Task ID: 14
# Title: Manual Testing of API Endpoints
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform manual testing of all implemented API endpoints to verify functionality.
# Details:
Test all implemented endpoints using tools like curl, Postman, or a web browser:
1. Test GET / endpoint and verify it returns {"message": "Hello, World!"} with a 200 status code
2. Test GET /health endpoint and verify it returns {"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "<ISO timestamp>"} with a 200 status code
3. Test error handling by accessing undefined routes and verifying 404 responses
4. Verify that request logging works correctly by checking console output

Document any issues found during testing.

# Test Strategy:
Create a test checklist covering all endpoints and expected behaviors. Execute the tests manually and document the results, including any unexpected behaviors or issues.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Postman Collection for API Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a Postman collection to organize and document all API tests. This will serve as both a testing tool and documentation for the API endpoints.
### Details:
1. Install Postman if not already available
2. Create a new collection named 'API Testing'
3. Set up environment variables for the base URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000)
4. Create folders within the collection for different endpoint categories (root, health, error handling)
5. Document the expected responses for each endpoint in the request descriptions

## 2. Test Root Endpoint Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Perform comprehensive testing of the root endpoint (GET /) to verify it returns the expected response with correct status code and content.
### Details:
1. Use Postman to send a GET request to the root endpoint (/)
2. Verify the status code is exactly 200
3. Verify the response body contains {"message": "Hello, World!"}
4. Check response headers to ensure Content-Type is application/json
5. Document the results including screenshots of the request and response
6. Test with different HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE) to verify they're properly rejected

## 3. Test Health Check Endpoint Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Perform comprehensive testing of the health check endpoint (GET /health) to verify it returns the expected status and timestamp information.
### Details:
1. Use Postman to send a GET request to the health endpoint (/health)
2. Verify the status code is exactly 200
3. Verify the response body contains {"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "<ISO timestamp>"}
4. Validate that the timestamp is in proper ISO format and represents the current time
5. Make multiple requests to verify the timestamp updates appropriately
6. Document the results including screenshots of the request and response

## 4. Test Error Handling and 404 Responses [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Test how the API handles undefined routes and error conditions to verify proper error handling and 404 responses.
### Details:
1. Send requests to non-existent endpoints (e.g., /nonexistent, /api/unknown)
2. Verify each returns a 404 status code
3. Check the response body format for error messages
4. Test malformed requests (if applicable) to verify error handling
5. Document all error responses and their formats
6. Verify that error responses maintain a consistent structure

## 5. Verify Request Logging and Create Test Report [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.3, 14.4
### Description: Verify that all API requests are properly logged to the console and create a comprehensive test report documenting all findings.
### Details:
1. Monitor the console output while executing all previous test cases
2. Verify each API request is logged with appropriate information (method, path, status code, response time)
3. Create a comprehensive test report document that includes:
   - Summary of all tests performed
   - Screenshots of requests and responses
   - List of any issues or inconsistencies found
   - Recommendations for improvements
4. Export the Postman collection for future use
5. Document any edge cases or potential issues discovered during testing
