# MCP Tools for Task 14: Manual Testing of API Endpoints

## Tool Selection Reasoning
This task involves manual testing of API endpoints and documenting results. I selected:
- **filesystem**: Essential for creating test reports, saving Postman collections, and documenting test results
- No remote tools needed as testing is performed manually via command line and GUI tools

## Selected Tools

### filesystem (Local Tool)
**Description**: File system operations including read, write, and directory management
**Why Selected**: Required to create test documentation, save test results, and export Postman collections
**Task-Specific Usage**: 
- Use `create_directory` to create a tests directory if needed
- Use `write_file` to create test report documentation
- Use `write_file` to save Postman collection JSON
- Use `read_file` to review created documentation

## Tool Usage Guidelines for This Task

### Documentation Creation
1. Create a tests directory for organizing test artifacts
2. Write test report as markdown file
3. Save Postman collection as JSON file
4. Document any issues found during testing

### Test Report Structure
Create comprehensive documentation including:
- Test execution summary
- Detailed test results for each endpoint
- Issues and observations
- Recommendations for improvements
- Evidence of test execution

## Example Tool Usage

```javascript
// Create tests directory
await filesystem.create_directory({
  path: "hello-world-api/tests"
});

// Create test report
const testReport = `# API Endpoint Test Report

## Test Information
- Date: ${new Date().toISOString()}
- Environment: Local Development
- Base URL: http://localhost:3000
- Tools Used: curl, Postman

## Test Summary
- Total Tests: 15
- Passed: 15
- Failed: 0
- Blocked: 0

## Detailed Results

### 1. Root Endpoint (/)

| Test Case | Method | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Valid GET | GET | 200, Hello World | 200, Hello World | PASS |
| Invalid POST | POST | 404 | 404 | PASS |
| Invalid PUT | PUT | 404 | 404 | PASS |
| Invalid DELETE | DELETE | 404 | 404 | PASS |

### 2. Health Endpoint (/health)

| Test Case | Method | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Valid GET | GET | 200, healthy | 200, healthy | PASS |
| Timestamp Fresh | GET | Different times | Different | PASS |
| Invalid POST | POST | 404 | 404 | PASS |

### 3. Error Handling

| Test Case | Path | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-----------|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Undefined Route | /api | 404 | 404 | PASS |
| Deep Path | /api/v1/test | 404 | 404 | PASS |
| Case Sensitive | /Health | 404 | 404 | PASS |

### 4. Request Logging

- ✓ All requests logged to console
- ✓ Correct timestamp format
- ✓ Method and path included

## Issues Found

No critical issues found during testing.

## Recommendations

1. Consider adding request ID for tracking
2. Add response time to logs
3. Consider rate limiting for production
4. Add health check details (uptime, memory)

## Conclusion

All endpoints functioning as expected. The API meets all functional requirements and is ready for use.

// Create Postman collection

await filesystem.write_file({
  path: "hello-world-api/tests/hello-world-api.postman_collection.json",
  content: JSON.stringify(postmanCollection, null, 2)
});
```

## Important Notes
- Manual testing is performed outside of MCP tools (using curl, Postman, etc.)
- The filesystem tool is used only for documenting results
- Test execution must be done with the server running
- Document both successful and failed test cases
- Include timestamps and environment details in reports
- Save Postman collections for future regression testing
