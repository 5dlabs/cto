# MCP Tools for Task 13: Create README Documentation

## Tool Selection Reasoning
This task involves creating a comprehensive README.md file for the Hello World API project. I selected:
- **filesystem**: Essential for creating and writing the README.md file in the project root
- No remote tools needed as this is a documentation creation task based on existing project knowledge

## Selected Tools

### filesystem (Local Tool)
**Description**: File system operations for reading, writing, and managing files  
**Why Selected**: Required to create the README.md file and potentially read existing files for reference  
**Task-Specific Usage**: 
- Use `write_file` to create README.md with comprehensive documentation
- Use `read_file` to verify the file was created correctly

**Key Operations**:
1. Create `README.md` in the project root directory
2. Write comprehensive documentation content
3. Verify the file was created successfully

## Tool Usage Guidelines for This Task

### Creating the README
```javascript
// 1. Create the README.md file with full documentation
const readmeContent = `# Hello World API

A simple Express.js API that provides basic REST endpoints with health monitoring.

## Table of Contents
- [Overview](#overview)
- [Features](#features)
...
[Full content as per template]
`

write_file("hello-world-api/README.md", readmeContent)

// 2. Verify the file was created
read_file("hello-world-api/README.md")
```

### Documentation Sections
The README should include:
1. **Project Overview**: Introduction and purpose
2. **Installation**: Step-by-step setup guide
3. **Usage**: How to start and configure the server
4. **API Documentation**: Detailed endpoint information
5. **Development**: Scripts and development workflow
6. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

### API Documentation Format
```markdown
#### GET /
Returns a welcome message.

**Response:**
- Status: `200 OK`
- Content-Type: `application/json`

\`\`\`json
{
  "message": "Hello, World!"
}
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`bash
curl http://localhost:3000/
\`\`\`
```

## Best Practices for This Task

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include all necessary sections for a complete README
2. **Accurate Examples**: Ensure all code examples and commands work correctly
3. **Clear Structure**: Use proper markdown formatting with headers and sections
4. **User Focus**: Write for developers who will use and contribute to the project

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't include** outdated or incorrect information
2. **Ensure** all API examples match the actual implementation
3. **Test** all commands before documenting them
4. **Include** troubleshooting for common issues

## Documentation Content Notes

The README should:
- Provide a clear project overview
- Include step-by-step installation instructions
- Document all API endpoints with examples
- Explain development setup and available scripts
- Address common troubleshooting scenarios
- Use professional tone and clear language

This minimal tool selection focuses on the essential file creation operation needed to produce comprehensive project documentation.
