## Test Cases

### Test 1: File Existence and Size
```bash
# Check file exists
test -f README.md && echo "✓ README.md exists" || echo "✗ README.md missing"

# Check file size
wc -l README.md
# Expected: > 200 lines
```

### Test 2: Section Completeness
```bash
# Check for required sections
sections=("Installation" "Usage" "API Documentation" "Features" "Prerequisites")
for section in "${sections[@]}"; do
  grep -q "## $section" README.md && echo "✓ $section found" || echo "✗ $section missing"
done
```

### Test 3: Endpoint Documentation
```bash
# Check both endpoints are documented
grep -q "GET /" README.md && echo "✓ Root endpoint documented"
grep -q "GET /health" README.md && echo "✓ Health endpoint documented"
```

### Test 4: Code Block Validation
```bash
# Count code blocks
grep -c '```' README.md
# Expected: Even number (all blocks closed)

# Check for curl examples
grep -c "curl http://localhost" README.md
# Expected: >= 2 (examples for each endpoint)
```

### Test 5: Command Accuracy
```bash
# Extract and test npm commands
grep -E "npm (start|install|run)" README.md
# All commands should be valid
```
