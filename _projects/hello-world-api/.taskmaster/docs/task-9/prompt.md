# Autonomous Agent Prompt: Implement Root Endpoint

## Context
You are continuing the development of a Hello World API. The Express.js server has been created with basic middleware for request logging. Now you need to implement the main API endpoint that returns a "Hello, World!" message.

## Objective
Add a root endpoint (GET /) to the Express application that returns a JSON response with a "Hello, World!" message and a 200 HTTP status code.

## Task Requirements

### 1. Add Route Handler
Modify `src/index.js` to include a GET route handler for the root path (/):
- Use Express's `app.get()` method
- Path should be '/'
- Handler should use request and response parameters

### 2. Implement JSON Response
The route handler should:
- Set HTTP status code to 200
- Return JSON response with structure: `{ "message": "Hello, World!" }`
- Use proper Express response methods

### 3. Code Placement
Ensure the route is added:
- After the request logging middleware
- Before the server.listen() call
- With appropriate comments

## Complete Implementation

The route handler to add to src/index.js:

```javascript
// Root endpoint - Returns a welcome message to confirm the API is working
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello, World!' });
});
```

## Integration Example

The complete src/index.js structure after adding the endpoint:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Middleware for request logging
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${new Date().toISOString()} - ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
});

// Root endpoint - Returns a welcome message to confirm the API is working
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello, World!' });
});

// Error handling for server startup
const server = app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});

// ... existing error handling code ...

module.exports = app;
```

## Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Open the server file**:
   - Locate src/index.js
   - Find the position after middleware but before server.listen()

2. **Add the route handler**:
   - Insert the GET / route handler
   - Include the descriptive comment
   - Ensure proper indentation

3. **Save and test**:
   - Save the file
   - Restart the server with `npm start`
   - Test the endpoint

## Validation Criteria

### Success Indicators
- [ ] Route handler added to src/index.js
- [ ] GET / returns JSON response
- [ ] Response has "message" field with "Hello, World!" value
- [ ] HTTP status code is 200
- [ ] Content-Type header is application/json
- [ ] Request is logged by middleware

### Testing Commands

1. **Basic Test**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/
   # Expected: {"message":"Hello, World!"}
   ```

2. **Detailed Test**:
   ```bash
   curl -v http://localhost:3000/
   # Should show 200 OK status and JSON content type
   ```

3. **Browser Test**:
   - Open http://localhost:3000/ in a web browser
   - Should display the JSON response

## Expected Behavior

### Server Console Output
When a request is made to the root endpoint:
```
2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z - GET /
```

### Client Response
```json
{"message":"Hello, World!"}
```

### HTTP Headers
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 27
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Wrong placement**: Don't add the route after app.listen()
2. **Missing status code**: Always explicitly set status(200)
3. **Wrong response method**: Use res.json(), not res.send()
4. **Syntax errors**: Ensure proper parentheses and semicolons
5. **Route conflicts**: Make sure no other middleware intercepts the route

## Error Handling Notes

- This endpoint doesn't process user input, so no validation needed
- The endpoint should always return successfully
- Any errors would be caught by Express's default error handler

## Important Notes

- The res.json() method automatically:
  - Sets Content-Type to application/json
  - Stringifies the JavaScript object
  - Sends the response
- The status(200) is explicit but could be omitted (200 is default)
- The route must be defined before any catch-all routes

## Tools Required
- File system access to modify src/index.js
- Text editing capability for JavaScript code
- Command execution for testing

Proceed with implementing the root endpoint, ensuring it returns the correct JSON response and integrates properly with the existing server code.
