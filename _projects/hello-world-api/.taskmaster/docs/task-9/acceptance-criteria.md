# Acceptance Criteria for Task 9: Implement Root Endpoint

## Required Outcomes

### 1. Route Implementation
- [ ] GET route handler exists for path '/'
- [ ] Route is defined in src/index.js
- [ ] Route is placed after middleware
- [ ] Route is placed before app.listen()

### 2. Response Format
- [ ] Returns JSON response
- [ ] Response contains "message" property
- [ ] Message value is exactly "Hello, World!"
- [ ] No extra properties in response

### 3. HTTP Standards
- [ ] HTTP status code is 200
- [ ] Content-Type header is "application/json"
- [ ] Response is valid JSON
- [ ] Follows RESTful conventions

### 4. Code Quality
- [ ] Route handler has descriptive comment
- [ ] Code follows Express.js conventions
- [ ] Proper error handling (if applicable)
- [ ] Clean, readable implementation

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Basic Endpoint Access
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/
# Expected output:
{"message":"Hello, World!"}
```

### Test 2: HTTP Status Verification
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:3000/
# Expected headers include:
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# Content-Type: application/json
```

### Test 3: JSON Validation
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/ | python3 -c "import sys, json; json.load(sys.stdin)"
# Expected: No errors (valid JSON)
```

### Test 4: Exact Response Verification
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/ | grep -q '"message":"Hello, World!"'
echo $?
# Expected: 0 (pattern found)
```

### Test 5: Request Logging
```bash
# Start server and make request
npm start
# In another terminal:
curl http://localhost:3000/
# Expected in server logs:
# [timestamp] - GET /
```

### Test 6: Multiple Requests
```bash
# Make multiple requests
for i in {1..5}; do curl -s http://localhost:3000/; echo; done
# Expected: Same response 5 times
```

## Response Validation

### Required Response Structure
```json
{
  "message": "Hello, World!"
}
```

### Response Requirements
- [ ] Valid JSON format
- [ ] Exactly one property: "message"
- [ ] Message contains exact text with punctuation
- [ ] No trailing commas or syntax errors
- [ ] Consistent response on every request

## Performance Criteria
- [ ] Response time < 100ms for local requests
- [ ] No memory leaks on repeated requests
- [ ] Handles concurrent requests properly
- [ ] No server errors or crashes

## Definition of Done
- GET / endpoint returns correct JSON response
- HTTP 200 status code is returned
- All test cases pass
- Code is properly commented
- Server remains stable during testing
- Ready for health endpoint implementation (Task 10)

## Common Issues to Avoid
1. Wrong message text (missing punctuation, wrong capitalization)
2. Incorrect JSON structure (missing quotes, wrong property name)
3. Not setting explicit status code
4. Route defined in wrong location
5. Using res.send() instead of res.json()
6. Adding extra properties to response

## Edge Cases to Consider
- [ ] Server handles malformed requests gracefully
- [ ] Endpoint works with different HTTP clients
- [ ] Response is consistent regardless of headers sent
- [ ] No issues with CORS (if applicable)
