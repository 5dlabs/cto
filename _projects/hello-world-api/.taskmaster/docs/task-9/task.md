# Task 9: Implement Root Endpoint

## Overview
This task implements the primary API endpoint that responds to GET requests at the root path (/) with a "Hello, World!" message in JSON format. This endpoint serves as the main functionality of the Hello World API and confirms the API is operational.

## Objectives
- Create a GET route handler for the root path (/)
- Return a JSON response with "Hello, World!" message
- Ensure proper HTTP status code (200) is returned
- Follow RESTful API conventions
- Add appropriate documentation

## Technical Approach

### 1. Route Handler Implementation
- Define GET route using Express.js routing
- Map root path (/) to handler function
- Implement request/response handling logic

### 2. Response Format
- Return JSON object with message property
- Structure: `{ "message": "Hello, World!" }`
- Set Content-Type header to application/json

### 3. HTTP Status Code
- Explicitly set status code to 200 (OK)
- Indicates successful request processing
- Follow HTTP status code conventions

### 4. Integration Points
- Route must be defined after middleware
- Route must be defined before server.listen()
- Ensure no route conflicts

## Dependencies
- Task 8: Main server file must exist
- Express.js app instance must be created
- Server must be properly initialized

## Expected Outcomes
1. GET / returns JSON response
2. Response contains "Hello, World!" message
3. HTTP status code is 200
4. Endpoint is accessible when server runs
5. Response headers indicate JSON content type

## API Specification
```
Endpoint: GET /
Response: 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Body: {
  "message": "Hello, World!"
}
```
