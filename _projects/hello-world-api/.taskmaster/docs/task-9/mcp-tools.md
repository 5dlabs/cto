# MCP Tools for Task 9: Implement Root Endpoint

## Tool Selection Reasoning
This task involves adding a route handler to an existing Express.js server file. I selected:
- **filesystem**: Essential for reading the current server file and editing it to add the new endpoint
- No remote tools needed as this is a simple code modification task

## Selected Tools

### filesystem (Local Tool)
**Description**: File system operations for reading, writing, and managing files  
**Why Selected**: Required to read the existing server file and make precise edits to add the route handler  
**Task-Specific Usage**: 
- Use `read_file` to examine the current src/index.js content
- Use `edit_file` to insert the route handler in the correct location

**Key Operations**:
1. Read current `src/index.js` to understand structure
2. Edit file to add GET / route handler after middleware
3. Verify the changes were applied correctly

## Tool Usage Guidelines for This Task

### Reading and Editing the Server File
```javascript
// 1. First read the current file to understand its structure
const currentCode = read_file("hello-world-api/src/index.js")

// 2. Add the route handler after the logging middleware
// Look for the middleware section and add the route after it
edit_file("hello-world-api/src/index.js", {
  old: `app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(\`\${new Date().toISOString()} - \${req.method} \${req.url}\`);
  next();
});

// Error handling for server startup`,
  new: `app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(\`\${new Date().toISOString()} - \${req.method} \${req.url}\`);
  next();
});

// Root endpoint - Returns a welcome message to confirm the API is working
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello, World!' });
});

// Error handling for server startup`
})
```

### Alternative Edit Approach (if structure differs)
```javascript
// If the file structure is different, locate the correct insertion point
// The route should be added:
// - After app initialization and middleware
// - Before app.listen() call

// The route handler to insert:
const routeHandler = `
// Root endpoint - Returns a welcome message to confirm the API is working
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello, World!' });
});`
```

### Validation Steps
```javascript
// 3. Read the file again to verify the route was added
read_file("hello-world-api/src/index.js")
// Should now include the GET / route handler
```

## Best Practices for This Task

1. **Precise Editing**: Use exact string matching to ensure edits are applied correctly
2. **Maintain Format**: Preserve existing code formatting and indentation
3. **Comment Inclusion**: Include the descriptive comment with the route
4. **Order Matters**: Ensure route is added after middleware but before server.listen()

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't duplicate** the route if it already exists
2. **Maintain** consistent code style with the existing file
3. **Ensure** the edit doesn't break existing functionality
4. **Place** the route in the correct position in the middleware chain

## Code Integration Notes

The route handler integrates with existing code:
- Uses the Express `app` instance already created
- Works with the existing request logging middleware
- Follows Express routing conventions
- Returns JSON using Express's built-in methods

This minimal tool selection focuses on the essential file editing operation needed to add the API endpoint to the existing server file.
