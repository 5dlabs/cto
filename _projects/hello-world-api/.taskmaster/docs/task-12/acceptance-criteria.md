## Quality Checks

### Documentation Standards
- [ ] Clear section headings (##, ###)
- [ ] Consistent code formatting
- [ ] Proper syntax highlighting in code blocks
- [ ] Explanatory text for each concept
- [ ] Practical examples

### Code Example Requirements
- [ ] All code examples are valid JavaScript/Express.js
- [ ] Examples use modern ES6+ syntax
- [ ] Examples include necessary imports
- [ ] Comments explain complex parts
- [ ] Examples are production-ready

### Research Quality
- [ ] Information is current (2024 standards)
- [ ] Multiple authoritative sources cited
- [ ] Balanced view of different approaches
- [ ] Pros and cons discussed where relevant
- [ ] Specific to Express.js 4.x/5.x

## Test Cases

### Test 1: File Structure Validation
```bash
# Check file exists
test -f docs/best-practices.md && echo "File exists" || echo "File missing"

# Check file size (should be substantial)
wc -l docs/best-practices.md
# Expected: > 500 lines
```

### Test 2: Section Completeness
```bash
# Check all required sections exist
sections=("Error Handling" "Middleware Organization" "Request Logging" "Security Best Practices")
for section in "${sections[@]}"; do
  grep -q "## $section" docs/best-practices.md && echo "✓ $section" || echo "✗ $section missing"
done
```

### Test 3: Code Block Validation
```bash
# Count code blocks
grep -c '```javascript' docs/best-practices.md
# Expected: > 10 code examples

# Check for proper code block closure
diff <(grep -c '```javascript' docs/best-practices.md) <(grep -c '```$' docs/best-practices.md)
# Expected: 0 (equal counts)
```

### Test 4: Reference Links
```bash
# Check for reference links
grep -E 'https?://[^\s]+' docs/best-practices.md | wc -l
# Expected: > 5 reference links
```

### Test 5: Table of Contents
```bash
# Verify TOC links match sections
grep '](#' docs/best-practices.md
# Expected: Links correspond to actual sections
```

## Content Validation

### Required Topics Coverage
- [ ] Express 4.x specific practices
- [ ] async/await patterns
- [ ] ES6+ module usage
- [ ] TypeScript considerations (optional)
- [ ] Testing strategies mentioned
- [ ] Deployment considerations

### Practical Application
- [ ] Examples relevant to Hello World API
- [ ] Suggestions for improving current code
- [ ] Migration paths for enhancements
- [ ] Performance impact discussed
- [ ] Security implications explained

## Definition of Done
- Comprehensive best practices document created
- All research areas thoroughly covered
- High-quality, actionable content
- Proper references and citations
- Code examples tested and valid
- Document useful for future development
- Follows markdown best practices

## Common Issues to Avoid
1. Outdated practices from Express 3.x
2. Generic Node.js practices not specific to Express
3. Missing security considerations
4. Incomplete code examples
5. No practical application examples
6. Missing error handling patterns
7. Ignoring performance implications

## Additional Considerations
- [ ] Document is accessible and well-organized
- [ ] Language is clear and professional
