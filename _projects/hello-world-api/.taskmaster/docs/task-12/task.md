# Task 12: Research Express.js Best Practices

## Overview
This task involves conducting comprehensive research on current Express.js best practices, focusing on error handling, middleware organization, request logging, and security. The findings will be documented in a structured markdown file to guide future development and ensure the API follows industry standards.

## Purpose and Objectives
- Research current Express.js best practices using web search
- Document error handling patterns and strategies
- Explore middleware organization approaches
- Investigate request logging best practices
- Compile security recommendations
- Create comprehensive documentation for team reference
- Ensure the project aligns with industry standards

## Technical Approach

### Research Strategy
1. **Web Search**: Use Brave Search for current information
2. **Topic Areas**: Focus on four key areas of Express.js development
3. **Documentation**: Compile findings in structured markdown
4. **Practical Focus**: Include implementable code examples
5. **References**: Cite sources for further reading

### Key Research Topics
- Error handling patterns (sync/async, global handlers)
- Middleware organization and execution order
- Logging strategies and libraries
- Security headers and vulnerability mitigation
- Performance optimization techniques
- Testing approaches

## Implementation Details

### Research Areas

#### 1. Error Handling Patterns
- Global error handler middleware
- Async/await error handling
- Error response formatting
- Error classification and types
- Logging strategies for errors

#### 2. Middleware Organization
- Middleware execution order
- Application vs router-level middleware
- Middleware categorization
- Custom middleware patterns
- Middleware composition

#### 3. Request Logging
- Morgan configurations
- Structured logging with Winston
- Log rotation strategies
- Correlation IDs
- Sensitive data protection

#### 4. Security Best Practices
- Helmet.js configuration
- CORS implementation
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- Authentication patterns
- Security headers
