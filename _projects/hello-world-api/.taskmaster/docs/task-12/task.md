# Task 12: Research Express.js Best Practices

## Overview

This task involves researching and documenting current Express.js best practices for building robust, secure, and maintainable APIs. The research will focus on four key areas: error handling patterns, middleware organization, request logging, and security best practices.

## Task Details

### Objective
Create a comprehensive best practices guide for Express.js development that can be used as a reference for improving the current API implementation and for future Express.js projects.

### Research Areas

1. **Error Handling Patterns**
   - Global error handler middleware implementation
   - Async/await error handling strategies
   - Structured error response formats
   - Error classification and categorization
   - Production vs. development error handling

2. **Middleware Organization**
   - Order of middleware registration
   - Application-level vs. router-level middleware
   - Middleware categorization strategies
   - Custom middleware implementation patterns
   - Middleware chaining and composition

3. **Request Logging**
   - Morgan configuration for different environments
   - Structured logging with Winston or similar libraries
   - Log rotation and management strategies
   - Request correlation IDs
   - Sensitive data masking in logs

4. **Security Best Practices**
   - Helmet.js configuration
   - CORS setup and management
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Authentication and authorization patterns
   - Security headers configuration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Research
- Review official Express.js documentation
- Analyze industry standards and recommendations
- Study popular Express.js projects and frameworks
- Gather insights from security advisories and vulnerability reports

### Phase 2: Documentation
- Create structured markdown documentation
- Include practical code examples
- Provide implementation guidance
- Add references and further reading resources

### Phase 3: Review and Application
- Review findings for applicability to current project
- Identify immediate improvements that can be made
- Create recommendations for future enhancements

## Deliverables

1. **docs/best-practices.md** - Main documentation file containing:
   - Table of contents
   - Detailed sections for each research area
   - Code examples and implementation patterns
   - References and resources

2. **Implementation recommendations** - Specific suggestions for applying best practices to the current API

## Success Criteria

- Comprehensive coverage of all four research areas
- Practical, implementable recommendations
- Clear code examples that can be adapted
- Current and relevant information (not outdated practices)
- Well-organized and easy-to-navigate documentation

## Dependencies

- Task 7: Install Express.js Dependency (completed)
- Access to Express.js documentation and resources
- Understanding of current API implementation

## Priority

Low - This is a research and documentation task that will improve code quality but is not critical for initial functionality.

## Estimated Effort

2-4 hours for comprehensive research and documentation
