# Task 12 Prompt: Research Express.js Best Practices

## Research Assignment

Research and document current Express.js best practices for building production-ready APIs. Focus your research on the following key areas:

### 1. Error Handling Patterns
- How to implement comprehensive error handling in Express.js
- Best practices for async error handling
- Error response formatting standards
- Logging strategies for errors

### 2. Middleware Organization
- Optimal middleware ordering and structure
- When to use application-level vs router-level middleware
- Custom middleware development patterns
- Middleware composition strategies

### 3. Request Logging
- Setting up Morgan for different environments
- Implementing structured logging
- Log management and rotation
- Security considerations for logging

### 4. Security Best Practices
- Essential security middleware (Helmet.js, CORS, etc.)
- Rate limiting implementation
- Input validation strategies
- Authentication and authorization patterns

## Deliverable Requirements

1. Create a comprehensive markdown document at `docs/best-practices.md`
2. Include practical code examples for each best practice
3. Provide clear implementation guidance
4. Add references to authoritative sources
5. Ensure all recommendations are current and relevant

## Research Sources

Consider using these resources:
- Official Express.js documentation
- OWASP guidelines for web application security
- Popular Express.js boilerplates and frameworks
- Recent security advisories and CVE reports
- Industry blogs and technical articles

## Expected Output

A well-structured best practices guide that serves as:
- A reference for improving the current API
- A template for future Express.js projects
- A learning resource for the development team

## Time Allocation

- Research: 1-2 hours
- Documentation writing: 1-2 hours
- Review and refinement: 30 minutes
