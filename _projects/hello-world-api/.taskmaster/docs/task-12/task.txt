# Task ID: 12
# Title: Research Express.js Best Practices
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Research and document current Express.js best practices for error handling and middleware.
# Details:
Research current Express.js best practices focusing on:
1. Error handling patterns
2. Middleware organization
3. Request logging
4. Security best practices

Document findings in a separate markdown file (docs/best-practices.md) that can be referenced for future improvements to the API.

# Test Strategy:
Review the documentation for completeness and accuracy. Ensure that the documented best practices are relevant to the project and provide valuable insights for potential improvements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research Express.js Error Handling Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research and document best practices for error handling in Express.js applications, including global error handlers, async error handling, and error formatting.
### Details:
Research error handling patterns in Express.js including: 1) Global error handler middleware, 2) Async/await error handling with express-async-errors or similar solutions, 3) Structured error response formats, 4) Error types and classification, 5) Error logging strategies. Document findings with code examples in the error handling section of docs/best-practices.md.

## 2. Research Express.js Middleware Organization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research and document best practices for organizing and structuring middleware in Express.js applications.
### Details:
Research middleware organization best practices including: 1) Order of middleware registration, 2) Application-level vs. router-level middleware, 3) Middleware categorization (security, parsing, logging, etc.), 4) Custom middleware implementation patterns, 5) Middleware chaining strategies. Document findings with examples in the middleware organization section of docs/best-practices.md.

## 3. Research Express.js Request Logging Approaches [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research and document best practices for request logging in Express.js applications, including popular logging libraries and configuration options.
### Details:
Research request logging approaches including: 1) Morgan configuration for different environments, 2) Winston or other structured logging libraries integration, 3) Log rotation and management, 4) Correlation IDs for request tracking, 5) Sensitive data masking in logs. Document findings with configuration examples in the request logging section of docs/best-practices.md.

## 4. Research Express.js Security Best Practices [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research and document security best practices for Express.js applications, including common vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.
### Details:
Research security best practices including: 1) Helmet.js configuration, 2) CORS setup, 3) Rate limiting strategies, 4) Input validation approaches, 5) Authentication patterns, 6) CSRF protection, 7) Security headers. Document findings with implementation examples in the security best practices section of docs/best-practices.md.

## 5. Compile and Format Best Practices Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4
### Description: Compile all research findings into a well-structured markdown document with a table of contents, code examples, and references.
### Details:
Create the docs/best-practices.md file with the following structure: 1) Introduction and purpose, 2) Table of contents, 3) Error handling patterns section, 4) Middleware organization section, 5) Request logging section, 6) Security best practices section, 7) References and further reading. Format the document with proper markdown syntax, including headings, code blocks, lists, and tables where appropriate. Include practical code examples that could be directly applied to our project.
