# Task 7: Install Express.js Dependency

## Overview
This task focuses on installing Express.js and essential middleware packages that form the foundation of the Hello World API. It establishes the core dependencies needed for building a robust web server with proper logging, security, and request handling capabilities.

## Objectives
- Install Express.js as the main web framework
- Add Morgan for HTTP request logging
- Install essential middleware (body-parser, cors, helmet)
- Configure Express.js settings
- Update npm scripts for development workflow

## Technical Approach

### 1. Core Framework Installation
- Install Express.js using npm
- Ensure it's saved as a production dependency
- Verify installation in package.json and node_modules

### 2. Middleware Stack Setup
Install critical middleware packages:
- **Morgan**: HTTP request logger for debugging and monitoring
- **Body-parser**: Parse incoming request bodies
- **CORS**: Handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **Helmet**: Add security-related HTTP headers

### 3. Configuration Management
- Create configuration structure at `src/config/express.js`
- Define environment-based settings
- Centralize port, environment, and logging configurations

### 4. Development Workflow Enhancement
- Install nodemon as a dev dependency for auto-reloading
- Update npm scripts for both production and development modes

## Dependencies
- Task 6 must be completed (Node.js project initialized)
- npm package manager available
- Internet connection for package downloads

## Expected Outcomes
1. Express.js and middleware packages installed and configured
2. Configuration file structure established
3. Development workflow scripts ready
4. Project prepared for server implementation

## Package Versions
- express: Latest stable version
- morgan: Latest stable version
