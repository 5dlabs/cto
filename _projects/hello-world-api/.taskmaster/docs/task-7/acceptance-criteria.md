# Acceptance Criteria for Task 7: Install Express.js Dependency

## Required Outcomes

### 1. Production Dependencies Installed
- [ ] `express` package is installed and listed in dependencies
- [ ] `morgan` package is installed and listed in dependencies
- [ ] `body-parser` package is installed and listed in dependencies
- [ ] `cors` package is installed and listed in dependencies
- [ ] `helmet` package is installed and listed in dependencies

### 2. Development Dependencies Installed
- [ ] `nodemon` package is installed and listed in devDependencies

### 3. Configuration Structure
- [ ] Directory `src/config/` exists
- [ ] File `src/config/express.js` exists
- [ ] Configuration file exports an object with:
  - [ ] `port` configuration with environment variable fallback
  - [ ] `env` configuration with environment variable fallback
  - [ ] `logLevel` configuration
  - [ ] `corsOptions` object
  - [ ] `bodyParserLimit` configuration
  - [ ] `morganFormat` configuration

### 4. Updated NPM Scripts
- [ ] `start` script exists: `"node src/index.js"`
- [ ] `dev` script exists: `"nodemon src/index.js"`

### 5. Package Integrity
- [ ] `package-lock.json` file exists
- [ ] All packages are resolved without conflicts
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in installed packages

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Verify Express Installation
```bash
# Check Express in package.json
grep '"express"' package.json
# Expected: Line showing express version

# Check Express in node_modules
ls node_modules/express/package.json
# Expected: File exists
```

### Test 2: Verify All Middleware
```bash
# Check all middleware in package.json
for pkg in morgan body-parser cors helmet; do
  grep "\"$pkg\"" package.json
done
# Expected: Each package appears in dependencies
```

### Test 3: Verify Development Dependencies
```bash
# Check nodemon in devDependencies
grep -A5 '"devDependencies"' package.json | grep '"nodemon"'
# Expected: nodemon version listed
```

### Test 4: Configuration File Validation
```bash
# Check configuration file
node -e "console.log(require('./src/config/express.js'))"
# Expected: Configuration object printed without errors
```

### Test 5: NPM Scripts Execution
```bash
# Test dev script
npm run dev -- --version
# Expected: Nodemon version displayed

# Check start script exists
npm run | grep start
# Expected: start script listed
```

## Definition of Done
- All required packages installed with no errors
- Configuration file properly structured
- NPM scripts functional
- No security vulnerabilities
- Ready for server implementation (Task 8)

## Common Issues to Avoid
1. Missing `--save` flag causing packages not to be added to package.json
2. Installing packages globally instead of locally
3. Configuration file with syntax errors
4. Missing directory creation before file creation
5. Incompatible package versions
6. Not updating package-lock.json

## Security Considerations
- All packages should be from official npm registry
- Check for known vulnerabilities using `npm audit`
- Use specific versions in production
- Keep dependencies up to date
