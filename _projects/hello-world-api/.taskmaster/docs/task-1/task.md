# Task 1: Initialize Node.js Project

## Overview

This task establishes the foundation for the Hello World API by setting up a proper Node.js project structure with Express.js as the web framework. This is the critical first step that enables all subsequent development.

## Purpose and Objectives

The primary objective is to create a well-structured Node.js project that serves as the foundation for building a simple Express.js API. This includes:

- Setting up a Node.js project with proper package.json configuration
- Installing Express.js as the web framework dependency
- Creating a standardized project directory structure
- Configuring npm scripts for easy server startup

## Technical Approach

### 1. Project Initialization
- Create a dedicated project directory
- Initialize npm to generate package.json with default settings
- Configure package metadata for the Hello World API

### 2. Dependency Management
- Install Express.js version 4.x as the primary dependency
- Ensure package-lock.json is created for reproducible installs

### 3. Project Structure
- Create a `src` directory to contain application source code
- Set up `src/index.js` as the main entry point
- Establish clear separation between configuration and code

### 4. Script Configuration
- Add a `start` script to package.json for running the server
- Configure the main entry point to `src/index.js`

## Implementation Details

### Step 1: Create Project Directory
```bash
mkdir hello-world-api
cd hello-world-api
```

### Step 2: Initialize Node.js Project
```bash
npm init -y
```

### Step 3: Install Express.js
```bash
npm install express
```

### Step 4: Create Project Structure
```bash
mkdir src
touch src/index.js
```

### Step 5: Update package.json
Update the generated package.json with appropriate configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "hello-world-api",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple Hello World API",
  "main": "src/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Create .gitignore
```bash
echo "node_modules/" > .gitignore
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

## Dependencies and Requirements

### System Requirements
- Node.js version 20 or higher
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Operating system: Windows, macOS, or Linux

### External Dependencies
- Express.js ^4.18.2 - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js

### Project Dependencies
- None - This is the initial setup task

## Testing Strategy

### Verification Steps
1. **Package.json Validation**
   - Verify package.json exists and contains correct metadata
   - Confirm Express.js is listed in dependencies
   - Check that the start script is properly configured

2. **Dependency Installation**
   ```bash
   npm list
   ```
   - Verify Express.js is installed
   - Check that node_modules directory exists

3. **Project Structure**
   - Confirm src directory exists
   - Verify src/index.js file is created
   - Check .gitignore contains node_modules entry

4. **Script Execution**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - Should attempt to run src/index.js (will fail if empty, which is expected)

### Test Commands
```bash
# Verify package.json structure
cat package.json

# Check installed dependencies
npm list --depth=0

# Test start script
npm run start
```

## Success Criteria

The task is considered complete when:
1. A `hello-world-api` directory exists with proper Node.js project structure
2. package.json is properly configured with project metadata and scripts
3. Express.js is installed as a dependency
4. The `src` directory and `src/index.js` file are created
5. A .gitignore file exists with appropriate entries
6. The `npm start` command is configured to run `node src/index.js`

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: npm command not found
**Solution**: Ensure Node.js is installed. Download from https://nodejs.org/

### Issue 2: Permission errors during npm install
**Solution**: 
- On Unix systems: Use `sudo npm install express` (not recommended)
- Better: Configure npm to use a different directory for global packages

### Issue 3: Express installation fails
**Solution**: 
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- Delete node_modules and package-lock.json, then reinstall

## Next Steps

After completing this task, proceed to:
- Task 2: Create Express.js Server - Implement the basic server with request logging
- Task 3: Implement Hello Endpoint - Add the root endpoint
- Task 4: Implement Health Check Endpoint - Add the health monitoring endpoint
