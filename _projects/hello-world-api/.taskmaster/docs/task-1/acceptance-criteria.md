│   ├── utils/             (directory)
│   ├── app.js             (file)
│   └── server.js          (file)
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/              (directory)
│   └── integration/       (directory)
├── docs/
│   └── openapi.yaml       (file)
├── .env                   (file)
├── .dockerignore          (file)
├── Dockerfile             (file)
├── kubernetes.yaml        (file)
├── README.md              (file)
├── package.json           (file)
├── package-lock.json      (file)
└── node_modules/          (directory)
```

### 4. Configuration Files

#### package.json Scripts
- [ ] Contains "start" script: `"start": "node src/server.js"`
- [ ] Contains "dev" script: `"dev": "nodemon src/server.js"`
- [ ] Contains "test" script: `"test": "jest --coverage"`
- [ ] Contains "lint" script: `"lint": "eslint ."`

#### .env File
- [ ] Contains PORT configuration (default: 3000)
- [ ] Contains NODE_ENV configuration (default: development)
- [ ] Contains LOG_LEVEL configuration (default: info)
- [ ] Contains API_VERSION configuration (default: 1.0.0)

#### .gitignore File
- [ ] Exists and includes node_modules/
- [ ] Includes .env (but not .env.example)
- [ ] Includes coverage/ directory
- [ ] Includes common IDE files (.vscode/, .idea/)
- [ ] Includes log files pattern

#### .dockerignore File
- [ ] Exists and includes node_modules/
- [ ] Includes test directories
- [ ] Includes .git directory
- [ ] Includes development files

### 5. Documentation
- [ ] README.md exists with basic project information
- [ ] README includes installation instructions
- [ ] README includes development setup instructions
- [ ] README includes list of API endpoints

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Verify Dependencies
**Steps:**
1. Run `npm list --depth=0`
2. Check the output for all required dependencies

**Expected Result:**
All specified dependencies are listed with correct versions.

### Test Case 2: Verify Scripts
**Steps:**
1. Run `npm run` to list available scripts
2. Verify all required scripts are present

**Expected Result:**
Scripts for start, dev, test, and lint are available.

### Test Case 3: Verify Project Structure
**Steps:**
1. Run `find . -type d -name "node_modules" -prune -o -type d -print | sort`
2. Compare output with required structure

**Expected Result:**
All required directories exist in the correct hierarchy.

### Test Case 4: Verify Configuration Files
**Steps:**
1. Check existence of .env file with `cat .env`
2. Check existence of .gitignore with `cat .gitignore`
3. Check existence of .dockerignore with `cat .dockerignore`

**Expected Result:**
All configuration files exist with appropriate content.

### Test Case 5: Development Server Script
**Steps:**
1. Run `npm run dev`

**Expected Result:**
- The nodemon command executes (will fail due to empty server.js)
- Error should indicate missing server implementation, not missing script

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] All test cases pass
- [ ] No npm security vulnerabilities at high or critical level
- [ ] Project structure is ready for development
- [ ] Configuration files are properly set up
- [ ] Documentation exists for project setup

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Installation completes within 2 minutes on standard development machine
- Total project size (excluding node_modules) is under 100KB
- Project follows Node.js best practices for structure
- Dependencies use exact versions for reproducibility
