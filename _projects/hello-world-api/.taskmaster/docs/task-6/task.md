# Task 6: Request Logging Enhancement

## Overview
This task focuses on ensuring comprehensive request logging is properly implemented in the Express.js server. While basic logging was added in Task 2, this task verifies and potentially enhances the logging middleware to meet production standards.

## Objectives
- Verify request logging middleware is properly implemented
- Ensure all HTTP requests are logged with appropriate details
- Confirm timestamp format is consistent (ISO 8601)
- Validate logging output for debugging purposes
- Consider enhancements for production use

## Technical Approach

### 1. Current Logging Implementation
The server should already have basic logging middleware:
```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${new Date().toISOString()} - ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
});
```

### 2. Logging Components
- **Timestamp**: ISO 8601 format for consistency
- **HTTP Method**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- **URL Path**: The requested endpoint
- **Future Considerations**: Status codes, response times, user agents

### 3. Middleware Positioning
Request logging must be the first middleware to capture all requests, including those that might fail in subsequent middleware.

## Implementation Details

### Verify Current Implementation
1. Check that logging middleware exists
2. Confirm it's positioned before all routes
3. Ensure it calls `next()` to continue processing
4. Test that all requests are logged

### Potential Enhancements
```javascript
// Enhanced logging with more details
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const start = Date.now();
  
  // Log request
  console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  
  // Log response (optional enhancement)
  res.on('finish', () => {
    const duration = Date.now() - start;
    console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] ${req.method} ${req.url} - ${res.statusCode} - ${duration}ms`);
  });
  
  next();
});
```

## Dependencies
- **Task 2**: Basic server implementation with initial logging
- **Express.js**: Provides middleware capabilities

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All HTTP requests are logged to console
- [ ] Logs include timestamp, method, and URL
- [ ] Timestamp format is ISO 8601
- [ ] Logging doesn't impact performance
- [ ] Logs appear for successful requests
- [ ] Logs appear for 404 errors
- [ ] Logs appear before error handling

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test various endpoints
curl http://localhost:3000/
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:3000/nonexistent
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Expected Log Output
```
2024-01-15T14:32:17.123Z - GET /
2024-01-15T14:32:18.456Z - GET /health
2024-01-15T14:32:19.789Z - GET /nonexistent
2024-01-15T14:32:20.012Z - POST /
2024-01-15T14:32:21.345Z - PUT /health
```

### Verification Points
1. Timestamps increment correctly
2. All HTTP methods are logged
3. Both valid and invalid URLs logged
4. No requests are missed
5. Format is consistent

## Production Considerations

### Log Management
- Consider log rotation strategies
- Implement log levels (info, warn, error)
- Structure logs for parsing (JSON format)
- Consider external logging services

### Security
- Don't log sensitive data (passwords, tokens)
- Be careful with request bodies
- Consider GDPR compliance for user data

### Performance
- Asynchronous logging for high traffic
- Buffer logs to reduce I/O
- Consider sampling for very high traffic

## Related Tasks
- **Task 2**: Initial logging implementation
- **Task 5**: Error logging in error handler
- **Task 8**: Testing will verify logs
- **Task 9**: May recommend logging best practices

## Notes
- Console.log is synchronous and can impact performance
- Consider using dedicated logging libraries (winston, pino, bunyan)
- Structured logging (JSON) is better for log aggregation
- Request ID generation helps trace requests through systems
