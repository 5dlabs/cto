# MCP Tools for Task 10: Implement Health Check Endpoint

## Tool Selection Reasoning
This task involves adding a health check route handler to the existing Express.js server file. I selected:
- **filesystem**: Essential for reading the current server file and editing it to add the health check endpoint
- No remote tools needed as this is a simple code modification task

## Selected Tools

### filesystem (Local Tool)
**Description**: File system operations for reading, writing, and managing files  
**Why Selected**: Required to read the existing server file and make precise edits to add the health check route  
**Task-Specific Usage**: 
- Use `read_file` to examine the current src/index.js content
- Use `edit_file` to insert the health check route in the correct location

**Key Operations**:
1. Read current `src/index.js` to understand structure
2. Edit file to add GET /health route handler after the root endpoint
3. Verify the changes were applied correctly

## Tool Usage Guidelines for This Task

### Reading and Editing the Server File
```javascript
// 1. First read the current file to understand its structure
const currentCode = read_file("hello-world-api/src/index.js")

// 2. Add the health check route after the root endpoint
// Look for the root endpoint and add the health check after it
edit_file("hello-world-api/src/index.js", {
  old: `// Root endpoint - Returns a welcome message to confirm the API is working
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello, World!' });
});

// Error handling for server startup`,
  new: `// Root endpoint - Returns a welcome message to confirm the API is working
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello, World!' });
});

// Health check endpoint
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
});

// Error handling for server startup`
})
```

### Alternative Edit Approach (if structure differs)
```javascript
// If the file structure is different, locate the correct insertion point
// The health check should be added:
// - After the root endpoint (GET /)
// - Before app.listen() call
// - With proper spacing and comments

// The route handler to insert:
const healthCheckRoute = `
// Health check endpoint
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
});`
```

### Validation Steps
```javascript
// 3. Read the file again to verify the route was added
read_file("hello-world-api/src/index.js")
// Should now include both GET / and GET /health routes
```

## Best Practices for This Task

1. **Precise Editing**: Use exact string matching to ensure edits are applied correctly
2. **Maintain Order**: Place health check after root endpoint for logical organization
3. **Consistent Style**: Match the formatting of existing routes
4. **Include Comments**: Add the descriptive comment with the route

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't place** the route after app.listen() where it won't be registered
2. **Ensure** timestamp uses toISOString() for correct ISO 8601 format
3. **Maintain** consistent indentation with existing code
4. **Don't forget** the status field in the response

## Code Integration Notes

The health check endpoint:
- Returns a static \"healthy\" status (appropriate for basic implementation)
- Generates a fresh timestamp for each request
- Uses standard Express routing patterns
- Follows the same response pattern as the root endpoint

This minimal tool selection focuses on the essential file editing operation needed to add the health check endpoint to the existing server file.
