# Task 10: Implement Health Check Endpoint

## Overview
This task implements a health check endpoint that provides real-time status information about the API service. The endpoint returns the service health status along with a timestamp, enabling monitoring tools and load balancers to verify the API is operational.

## Objectives
- Create GET /health endpoint
- Return service status and ISO timestamp
- Implement proper HTTP status codes
- Consider adding extended health information
- Support monitoring and operational needs

## Technical Approach

### 1. Basic Health Endpoint
- Define GET route for /health path
- Return JSON with status and timestamp
- Use HTTP 200 for healthy status

### 2. Timestamp Generation
- Use JavaScript Date object
- Format as ISO 8601 string
- Ensure timezone information included

### 3. Status Determination
- Initially return hardcoded "healthy" status
- Consider future enhancements for dynamic status
- Plan for service dependency checks

### 4. Extended Health Information (Optional)
- Process uptime
- Memory usage statistics
- CPU information
- Version information

## Dependencies
- Task 8: Main server file must exist
- Express.js app must be initialized
- No external service dependencies for basic implementation

## Expected Outcomes
1. GET /health returns JSON response
2. Response includes "status" and "timestamp" fields
3. Timestamp is in ISO 8601 format
4. HTTP 200 status code for healthy state
5. Endpoint suitable for monitoring tools

## API Specification
```
Endpoint: GET /health
Response: 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Body: {
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2023-12-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Extended Response (Optional)
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2023-12-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "memory": {
    "free": 1073741824,
    "total": 8589934592
  },
  "cpu": 8
}
```
