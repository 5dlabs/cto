			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Node.js Project",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Node.js project initialization into subtasks covering: 1) Project directory and npm setup, 2) Express installation and dependency management, 3) Project structure and configuration files",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward task for anyone familiar with Node.js. The steps are well-defined, sequential, and require minimal decision-making. The package.json example is provided, making implementation clear."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create Express.js Server",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Express.js server implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Basic server setup with port configuration, 2) Request logging middleware implementation, 3) Server startup and error handling",
			"reasoning": "This task involves slightly more technical knowledge than the first one, requiring understanding of Express.js concepts like middleware and server configuration. The example code is provided, but proper implementation requires understanding the concepts."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Hello Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Hello endpoint implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Route handler implementation with proper status code and response format, 2) Testing and validation of the endpoint behavior",
			"reasoning": "This is a simple endpoint implementation with provided code. The complexity is low as it only requires adding a single route handler to the existing Express application. The response format is straightforward JSON."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Health Check Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the health check endpoint implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Route handler implementation with status and timestamp generation, 2) Testing and validation of the dynamic timestamp functionality",
			"reasoning": "Similar to the Hello endpoint, this task is straightforward with provided code. The only slight increase in complexity is the dynamic timestamp generation, but it uses standard JavaScript Date methods."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Add Error Handling and Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the error handling and documentation task into subtasks covering: 1) Implementation of 500 error middleware, 2) Implementation of 404 handler for undefined routes, 3) Creation of comprehensive README with installation instructions, 4) Documentation of API endpoints with example responses",
			"reasoning": "This task combines two different concerns - error handling middleware and documentation creation. It requires understanding Express.js error handling patterns and creating well-structured documentation. The task involves more files and more comprehensive testing."
