# Task ID: 6
# Title: Initialize Node.js Project
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a new Node.js project with package.json configuration for the Hello World API.
# Details:
Create a new directory for the project. Run 'npm init -y' to generate a basic package.json file. Update the package.json with appropriate project name, description, and author information. Add a start script that runs the main server file: "start": "node src/index.js". Create the basic project structure with a src directory.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that package.json is correctly configured with proper project metadata and scripts. Ensure the project structure is set up correctly with the necessary directories.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Project Directory Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new directory for the Node.js project and set up the basic folder structure including the src directory.
### Details:
Create a new directory named 'hello-world-api'. Inside this directory, create a 'src' folder which will contain all source code. Also create placeholder files: 'src/index.js' for the main application entry point.

## 2. Initialize npm Project [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Run npm init to generate a basic package.json file with default values.
### Details:
Navigate to the project directory in the terminal and run 'npm init -y' to generate a package.json file with default values. This will create the initial configuration for the Node.js project.

## 3. Update Package.json Metadata [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Modify the package.json file with appropriate project information including name, description, author, and version.
### Details:
Open the package.json file and update the following fields: 'name' to 'hello-world-api', 'description' to 'A simple Hello World API built with Node.js', 'version' to '1.0.0', and 'author' with your information. Also set 'private' to true and update the license as needed.

## 4. Configure npm Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Add npm scripts to package.json, including the start script that will run the main server file.
### Details:
In the package.json file, update or add the 'scripts' section to include: 'start': 'node src/index.js' for running the application, and optionally add 'dev': 'nodemon src/index.js' if you plan to use nodemon for development.

## 5. Create .gitignore File [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Set up a .gitignore file to exclude node_modules and other unnecessary files from version control.
### Details:
Create a .gitignore file in the project root directory. Add entries for 'node_modules/', '.env', 'npm-debug.log', '.DS_Store', and any other files/directories that should not be tracked by version control.
