# Task ID: 13
# Title: Create README Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a README.md file with usage instructions and API documentation.
# Details:
Create a README.md file in the project root with the following sections:
1. Project Overview
2. Installation Instructions
3. Usage Instructions
4. API Endpoints Documentation
   - GET / - Hello World endpoint
   - GET /health - Health check endpoint
5. Development Setup

Include examples of how to call the API endpoints and what responses to expect.

Review the README for clarity, completeness, and accuracy. Ensure that all instructions are easy to follow and that the API documentation correctly describes the implemented endpoints.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Project Overview Section [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Write the Project Overview section of the README.md file, providing a clear introduction to the project, its purpose, and key features.
### Details:
Create the initial README.md file with a project overview section that includes:
- Project name and tagline
- Brief description of what the project does
- Key features and functionality
- Technologies used (Express.js, Node.js, etc.)
- Project status (e.g., in development, beta, production)

Example format:
```
# Project Name

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

## Overview

This is a simple Express.js API that provides basic endpoints for demonstration purposes. The project serves as a starting point for building more complex APIs with Node.js and Express.

### Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- JavaScript
```

## 2. Write Installation and Setup Instructions [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Document the steps required to install, configure, and run the application locally.
### Details:
Add the Installation and Development Setup sections to the README.md with clear step-by-step instructions:

## Installation Instructions
- Prerequisites (Node.js version, npm, etc.)
- Clone repository instructions
- Dependencies installation command (`npm install`)
- Configuration steps if any (environment variables, config files)

## Development Setup
- How to run the server in development mode
- Available npm scripts
- How to run tests if applicable
- Any other development-specific information

Example format:
```
## Installation

1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [project-directory]
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development Setup

1. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Available scripts
   - `npm start` - Start the production server
   - `npm run dev` - Start the development server with hot-reload
   - `npm test` - Run tests
```

## 3. Document Usage Instructions [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Create the Usage Instructions section explaining how to use the application after installation.
### Details:
Add a Usage Instructions section that explains how to interact with the API after installation. Include:

- How to start the server
- Basic usage patterns
- Common use cases
- Any configuration options that can be adjusted

Example format:
```
## Usage

1. Start the server
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. The server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`

3. You can now make requests to the available endpoints (see API Documentation section below)

4. To customize the port, set the PORT environment variable:
   ```bash
   PORT=8080 npm start
   ```
```

## 4. Create API Endpoints Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Document all API endpoints with request/response examples and parameter descriptions.
### Details:
Add a comprehensive API Endpoints Documentation section that details:

- All available endpoints
- HTTP methods supported
- Request parameters and body format (if applicable)
- Response format with status codes
- Example requests and responses using curl or similar

Example format:
```
## API Documentation
