# Task ID: 10
# Title: Deployment and Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Prepare the application for production deployment with Docker, CI/CD, and create comprehensive API and user documentation. Research deployment patterns from multiple sources and create comprehensive deployment configurations.
# Details:
1. Create production Docker setup (requires file operations):
   - Multi-stage builds for frontend and backend
   - Nginx configuration for serving the frontend
   - Docker Compose for local deployment
   - Kubernetes manifests (required, not optional)

2. Research deployment patterns (requires web search and Kubernetes tools):
   - Study Kubernetes deployment patterns and service configurations
   - Research best practices from Rust ecosystem for deployment and monitoring
   - Analyze modern microservices deployment architectures
   - Document findings to inform implementation decisions

3. Set up CI/CD pipeline (requires file operations and web search):
   - Research modern CI/CD pipeline examples
   - GitHub Actions or similar
   - Automated testing
   - Build and deployment steps
   - Environment-specific configurations

4. Create API documentation (requires file operations):
   - OpenAPI/Swagger specification
   - API endpoint documentation
   - Authentication flow documentation
   - WebSocket events documentation

5. Write user documentation (requires file operations):
   - User guide with screenshots
   - Feature explanations
   - FAQ section

6. Implement monitoring and logging (requires web search and Rust ecosystem research):
   - Error tracking (Sentry or similar)
   - Performance monitoring
   - Log aggregation
   - Research Rust ecosystem monitoring patterns

Example production Docker setup:
```dockerfile
# Frontend Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

# Backend Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=build /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=build /app/package*.json ./
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

Example docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
      - backend

  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@postgres:5432/chatapp
      - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
      - JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
      - JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-refresh-secret
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - redis

  postgres:
    image: postgres:14-alpine
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
      - POSTGRES_DB=chatapp
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    volumes:
      - redis-data:/data

volumes:
  postgres-data:
  redis-data:
```

# Test Strategy:
Test deployment process in staging environment. Verify zero-downtime deployments. Test database migrations in production-like environment. Validate documentation accuracy and completeness. Test monitoring and alerting systems. Verify Kubernetes configurations against best practices. Compare implemented deployment patterns with research findings from Rust ecosystem and other sources.
