## Testing Checklist

### Upload Tests
```javascript
describe('File Upload', () => {
  it('accepts valid file types');
  it('rejects invalid types');
  it('enforces size limits');
  it('shows upload progress');
  it('handles multiple files');
  it('generates thumbnails');
});
```

### Integration Tests
1. **Complete Upload Flow**
   - Select files
   - Upload with progress
   - See in message
   - Click to preview
   - Download file

2. **Error Scenarios**
   - Large file rejection
   - Invalid type error
   - Network failure
   - Storage error
   - Access denied

## Definition of Done

The task is complete when:
1. Files upload successfully
2. Images show thumbnails
3. Lightbox navigation works
4. Downloads authenticated
5. Progress indication smooth
6. Error handling comprehensive
7. Mobile experience good
8. Security measures in place
9. Performance acceptable
10. All tests passing

## Common Issues to Avoid

- ❌ No file type validation
- ❌ Missing size limits
- ❌ Insecure file access
- ❌ Memory leaks in preview
- ❌ Poor mobile experience
- ❌ No progress indication
- ❌ Unhandled upload errors
- ❌ Missing access control

## Verification Steps

```bash
# Test file upload
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "files=@test-image.jpg" \
  -F "files=@document.pdf"

# Verify S3 storage
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket/uploads/
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket/thumbnails/

# Test download
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/download/file-id

# Check performance
# Upload 10MB file and verify < 30s
# Thumbnail generation < 2s
# Lightbox open < 100ms
```
