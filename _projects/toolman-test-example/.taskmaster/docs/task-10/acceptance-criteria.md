## Testing Checklist

### Deployment Testing
```bash
# Build images
docker build -t chat-frontend:test ./frontend
docker build -t chat-backend:test ./backend

# Test with docker-compose
docker-compose up
# Verify all services healthy
# Test basic functionality

# Deploy to K8s
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=300s deployment/chat-backend -n chat-app
kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=300s deployment/chat-frontend -n chat-app

# Test endpoints
curl https://chat.domain.com/health
curl https://chat.domain.com/api/health
```

### Documentation Testing
```bash
# Validate OpenAPI spec
npx @apidevtools/swagger-cli validate docs/openapi.yaml

# Test README instructions
# Follow quick start guide
# Verify all commands work
```

## Definition of Done

The task is complete when:
1. Docker images build successfully
2. Images optimized for size
3. Kubernetes deployment works
4. CI/CD pipeline passes
5. Auto-scaling configured
6. API fully documented
7. User guide comprehensive
8. Monitoring operational
9. Security hardened
10. All tests passing

## Common Issues to Avoid

- ❌ Hardcoded values in configs
- ❌ Missing health checks
- ❌ No resource limits
- ❌ Secrets in code/images
- ❌ Missing documentation
- ❌ No rollback strategy
- ❌ Untested deployments
- ❌ No monitoring setup

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check Docker images
docker images | grep chat-app
# Verify sizes are optimized

# Test Kubernetes deployment
kubectl get all -n chat-app
# All pods should be running

# Check ingress
kubectl get ingress -n chat-app
# Should show configured routes

# Test autoscaling
kubectl get hpa -n chat-app
# Should show metrics and targets

# Verify monitoring
curl http://backend:3001/metrics
# Should return Prometheus metrics
```
