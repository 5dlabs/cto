   - Set up GitHub Actions workflows
   - Implement automated testing stages
   - Configure automated deployment to Kubernetes

5. **Create API Documentation**
   - Write complete OpenAPI/Swagger specification
   - Document all REST endpoints
   - Include WebSocket event documentation
   - Provide authentication flow examples

6. **Write User Documentation**
   - Create user guide with feature explanations

   - Write troubleshooting guide

7. **Set Up Monitoring and Logging**
   - Research Rust ecosystem monitoring patterns
   - Implement Prometheus metrics collection
   - Configure structured logging with tracing
   - Set up alerting and dashboards

## Research Requirements

Before implementation, conduct thorough research on:

1. **Kubernetes Patterns**
   - Deployment strategies (rolling update, blue-green, canary)
   - Service mesh considerations
   - Security best practices (RBAC, network policies)
   - Resource management and autoscaling

2. **Rust Deployment Patterns**
   - Best practices for containerizing Rust applications
   - Optimal build configurations for production
   - Monitoring and observability in Rust ecosystem
   - Performance tuning for production workloads

3. **CI/CD Best Practices**
   - Modern pipeline patterns
   - Security scanning integration
   - Automated testing strategies
   - GitOps deployment approaches

## Implementation Guidelines

### Docker Configuration
- Use Alpine Linux for smaller image sizes where possible
- Implement proper layer caching in multi-stage builds
- Configure health checks for all services
- Apply security best practices (non-root users, minimal base images)

### Kubernetes Setup
- Use namespaces for environment isolation
- Implement proper RBAC policies
- Configure resource requests and limits
- Set up pod disruption budgets
- Use ConfigMaps and Secrets appropriately

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Implement parallel testing stages
- Include security scanning (SAST, container scanning)
- Use semantic versioning for releases
- Implement approval gates for production deployments
- Configure rollback capabilities

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples for all features
- Provide visual diagrams where helpful
- Maintain versioned documentation
- Include migration guides

### Monitoring Requirements
- Implement RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration)
- Configure distributed tracing
- Set up log aggregation
- Create actionable alerts
- Design informative dashboards

## Security Considerations

1. **Container Security**
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities
   - Use minimal base images
   - Run as non-root users
   - Implement read-only root filesystems where possible

2. **Kubernetes Security**
   - Enable RBAC
   - Use network policies
   - Implement pod security policies
   - Configure secrets encryption at rest

3. **Application Security**
   - Use TLS for all communications
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Configure CORS appropriately
   - Add security headers

## Testing Requirements

1. **Deployment Testing**
   - Test all Docker builds
   - Validate Kubernetes manifests
   - Test CI/CD pipeline stages
   - Verify rollback procedures

2. **Documentation Testing**
   - Validate all code examples
   - Test API endpoints against documentation
   - Verify user guide accuracy
   - Check monitoring alerts

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Load test the deployed application
   - Verify autoscaling behavior
   - Test resource limits
   - Monitor application metrics

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Docker Assets**
   - Production Dockerfiles for frontend and backend
   - Docker Compose configuration
   - Nginx configuration with security headers
   - Build optimization documentation

2. **Kubernetes Manifests**
   - Deployment configurations
   - Service definitions
   - Ingress configuration
   - ConfigMaps and Secrets
   - Network policies
   - RBAC policies

3. **CI/CD Configuration**
   - GitHub Actions workflows
   - Build and test stages
   - Deployment automation
   - Environment-specific configurations

4. **Documentation**
   - Complete OpenAPI specification
   - User guide with screenshots
   - Deployment guide
   - Monitoring setup guide
   - Troubleshooting documentation

5. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Prometheus configuration
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Alert rules
   - Logging configuration

## Success Criteria
