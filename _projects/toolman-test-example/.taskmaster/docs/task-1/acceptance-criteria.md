  - [ ] `docker-compose.yml`
  - [ ] `.gitignore`
  - [ ] `.eslintrc.js`
  - [ ] `.prettierrc`
  - [ ] `README.md`

### 2. Frontend Configuration

- [ ] TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`) present and properly configured:
  - [ ] Strict mode enabled
  - [ ] Path aliases configured for `@/` and `@shared/`
  - [ ] Appropriate compiler options for React development
- [ ] Package.json includes all necessary dependencies:
  - [ ] React 18+
  - [ ] TypeScript
  - [ ] Development dependencies (Vite/CRA, ESLint, Prettier)
- [ ] Development server starts without errors
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds with no errors

### 3. Backend Configuration

- [ ] Node.js/Express application initialized with TypeScript
- [ ] TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`) present and properly configured:
  - [ ] Strict mode enabled
  - [ ] Output directory configured
  - [ ] Path aliases configured
- [ ] Package.json includes all necessary dependencies:
  - [ ] Express
  - [ ] TypeScript and type definitions
  - [ ] Development tools (nodemon, ts-node)
  - [ ] Security packages (helmet, cors)
- [ ] Development server starts without errors
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds with no errors

### 4. Development Tooling

- [ ] ESLint configuration works for both frontend and backend
- [ ] Prettier configuration applies consistent formatting
- [ ] Linting commands execute without configuration errors
- [ ] Format commands successfully format code
- [ ] Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore

### 5. Docker Configuration

- [ ] Frontend Dockerfile exists and builds successfully
- [ ] Backend Dockerfile exists and builds successfully
- [ ] Docker Compose configuration is valid
- [ ] All services start with `docker-compose up`
- [ ] Container networking allows frontend to communicate with backend
- [ ] Volume mounting enables hot reloading in development

### 6. Kubernetes Readiness

- [ ] Basic deployment YAML files created for:
  - [ ] Backend deployment
  - [ ] Frontend deployment (if applicable)
- [ ] Deployment configurations include:
  - [ ] Appropriate resource limits and requests
  - [ ] Health check configurations
  - [ ] Environment variable management
- [ ] YAML files pass validation (kubectl --dry-run=client)

### 7. Environment Configuration

- [ ] Environment variable templates created:
  - [ ] `.env.example` or `.env.template`
  - [ ] Clear documentation of required variables
- [ ] Sensitive data excluded from version control
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations properly separated

## Functional Testing

### Development Workflow Tests

1. **Hot Reloading Verification**
   - [ ] Modify a React component and verify browser updates without manual refresh
   - [ ] Modify a backend route and verify server restarts automatically
   - [ ] Changes in shared folder trigger rebuilds in both frontend and backend

2. **Build Process Testing**
   - [ ] `npm run build` executes successfully for frontend
   - [ ] `npm run build` executes successfully for backend
   - [ ] Built artifacts are created in appropriate directories
   - [ ] Production builds are optimized (minified, tree-shaken)

3. **Script Execution**
   - [ ] `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend
   - [ ] `npm run lint` executes across entire codebase
   - [ ] `npm run format` applies formatting consistently
   - [ ] All package.json scripts execute without errors

### Container Testing

1. **Docker Build Verification**
   ```bash
   # Test frontend container build
   docker build -t chat-frontend ./frontend
   
   # Test backend container build
   docker build -t chat-backend ./backend
   ```
   - [ ] Both builds complete successfully
   - [ ] Image sizes are reasonable (frontend < 100MB, backend < 300MB)

2. **Docker Compose Testing**
   ```bash
   # Start all services
   docker-compose up
   ```
   - [ ] All services start without errors
   - [ ] Frontend accessible at configured port
   - [ ] Backend API responds to health checks
   - [ ] Services can communicate with each other

3. **Container Hot Reload Testing**
   - [ ] Code changes reflect in running containers
   - [ ] File watching works correctly in containers
   - [ ] No permission issues with mounted volumes

### Integration Testing

1. **Cross-Service Communication**
   - [ ] Frontend can make API calls to backend
   - [ ] CORS is properly configured
   - [ ] Environment variables are correctly passed to containers

2. **TypeScript Integration**
   - [ ] Shared types are accessible from both frontend and backend
   - [ ] No TypeScript errors when importing shared code
   - [ ] IntelliSense works across project boundaries

## Performance Criteria

- [ ] Development server startup time < 10 seconds
- [ ] Hot reload updates < 2 seconds
- [ ] Docker container build time < 2 minutes
- [ ] Production build time < 5 minutes

## Security Checklist

- [ ] No secrets or sensitive data in committed files
- [ ] Environment variables used for all configuration
- [ ] Docker images use non-root users
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date with no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Security headers configured (helmet in backend)

## Documentation Verification

- [ ] README.md includes:
  - [ ] Project setup instructions
  - [ ] Available scripts documentation
  - [ ] Environment variable documentation
  - [ ] Development workflow guide
- [ ] Code comments explain non-obvious configurations
- [ ] Research findings documented for architectural decisions

## Final Validation

Run the following commands in sequence to validate the complete setup:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Run linting
npm run lint

# 3. Run formatting
npm run format

# 4. Start development environment
npm run dev

# 5. In another terminal, run builds
npm run build

# 6. Test Docker setup
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

All commands should execute successfully without errors for the task to be considered complete.
