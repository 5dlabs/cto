# Task 1: Setup Project Structure and Environment - Acceptance Criteria

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Project Structure ✓
- [ ] Root directory named `chat-application` exists
- [ ] Monorepo structure with `frontend` and `backend` directories
- [ ] `kubernetes` directory with subdirectories for configs
- [ ] All required configuration files present at root level

### 2. Frontend Setup ✓
- [ ] React 18+ application created with Vite
- [ ] TypeScript properly configured with strict mode
- [ ] Essential dependencies installed (react-router-dom, socket.io-client, axios)
- [ ] Development server runs on port 5173
- [ ] Hot module replacement (HMR) working

### 3. Backend Setup ✓
- [ ] Node.js Express server initialized
- [ ] TypeScript configuration complete
- [ ] Core dependencies installed (express, socket.io, cors, helmet)
- [ ] Development server runs on port 3000
- [ ] Nodemon configured for auto-restart

### 4. Docker Configuration ✓
- [ ] Dockerfile.dev exists for both frontend and backend
- [ ] docker-compose.yml configured for development
- [ ] docker-compose.prod.yml configured for production
- [ ] Containers build successfully without errors
- [ ] Volume mounts working for code synchronization
- [ ] Container networking properly configured

### 5. Code Quality Tools ✓
- [ ] ESLint configured at root level with TypeScript support
- [ ] Prettier configured with consistent formatting rules
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configs are compatible (no conflicts)
- [ ] Linting scripts work for entire project
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks configured with Husky

### 6. Environment Configuration ✓
- [ ] .env.example files exist for frontend and backend
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Different configs for dev/staging/prod environments
- [ ] Sensitive data excluded from version control

## Technical Validation

### Build and Runtime Tests
```bash
# Test 1: Install dependencies
cd chat-application && npm install
✓ All dependencies install without errors

# Test 2: Run development environment
npm run dev
✓ Both frontend and backend start successfully
✓ Frontend accessible at http://localhost:5173
✓ Backend accessible at http://localhost:3000

# Test 3: Build Docker images
docker-compose build
✓ All images build successfully
✓ No build errors or warnings

# Test 4: Run containerized environment
docker-compose up
✓ All containers start without errors
✓ Services are accessible at configured ports
✓ Hot reloading works in containers

# Test 5: Run linting
npm run lint
✓ ESLint runs across entire project
✓ No critical linting errors

# Test 6: Run formatting
npm run format
✓ Prettier formats all files successfully
✓ No formatting errors
```

### File Structure Validation
```bash
# Verify directory structure
tree -L 2 chat-application/

chat-application/
├── backend/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── Dockerfile.dev
│   ├── package.json
│   └── tsconfig.json
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── Dockerfile.dev
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── tsconfig.json
│   └── vite.config.ts
├── kubernetes/
│   ├── configmaps/
│   ├── deployment-configs/
│   └── services/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── docker-compose.prod.yml
├── .eslintrc.js
├── .gitignore
├── .prettierrc
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## Performance Criteria

### Development Experience
- [ ] Frontend hot reload < 500ms
- [ ] Backend restart < 2s with nodemon
- [ ] Docker build time < 3 minutes (first build)
- [ ] Subsequent Docker builds < 30s (with cache)

### Code Quality Metrics
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled (no any types)
- [ ] ESLint configured with recommended rules
- [ ] 100% of code formatted with Prettier
- [ ] Git hooks prevent commits with linting errors

## Documentation Requirements

### README.md Contents
- [ ] Project overview and architecture
- [ ] Prerequisites and system requirements
- [ ] Step-by-step setup instructions
- [ ] Available npm scripts documentation
- [ ] Environment variable reference
- [ ] Troubleshooting section
- [ ] Contribution guidelines

### Code Documentation
- [ ] Package.json files have accurate descriptions
- [ ] TypeScript configs documented with comments
- [ ] Docker configurations explained
- [ ] Environment variables documented in .env.example

## Security Validation

### Configuration Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] .gitignore properly configured
- [ ] Environment variables used for sensitive data
- [ ] Docker images don't contain source maps in production
- [ ] Proper CORS configuration in backend

## Final Checklist

### Must Pass All:
- [ ] `npm install` completes without errors
- [ ] `npm run dev` starts both services
- [ ] `docker-compose up` runs successfully
- [ ] TypeScript compilation has zero errors
- [ ] ESLint reports no critical issues
- [ ] All required files and directories exist
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in configuration

### Bonus Achievements:
- [ ] Docker multi-stage builds implemented
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests created
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configuration added
- [ ] Health check endpoints configured
- [ ] Development seeds/fixtures included

## Test Commands Summary
```bash
# Full validation sequence
cd chat-application
npm install
npm run lint
npm run format
npm run dev (Ctrl+C to stop)
docker-compose build
docker-compose up (Ctrl+C to stop)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build
```

**Task is considered complete when all required criteria are met and test commands execute successfully.**
