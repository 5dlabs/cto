- [ ] `make test` runs test suites
- [ ] `make deploy` handles deployment
- [ ] `make clean` cleans artifacts
- [ ] `make help` shows usage information

**Verification**:
```bash
make help
make build
make test
make clean
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Development Experience
**Requirement**: Smooth developer workflow
- [ ] Complete project builds in under 5 minutes on standard hardware
- [ ] Clear error messages when builds fail
- [ ] Development dependencies are minimized
- [ ] Hot reload capabilities where applicable

### NFR-2: Security
**Requirement**: Security best practices
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in any files
- [ ] Minimal attack surface in container images
- [ ] Security scanning integrated in CI/CD
- [ ] Proper file permissions set

### NFR-3: Cross-Platform Compatibility
**Requirement**: Works on multiple platforms
- [ ] Builds successfully on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)
- [ ] Builds successfully on macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- [ ] Windows compatibility with WSL2
- [ ] Container images support both amd64 and arm64

### NFR-4: Maintainability
**Requirement**: Code is maintainable and extensible
- [ ] Clear directory structure and naming conventions
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation in README files
- [ ] Consistent coding standards across all languages
- [ ] Version pinning for all dependencies

## Test Cases

### TC-1: Fresh Environment Setup
**Scenario**: New developer setting up the project
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd cli-agnostic-platform
make build
```
**Expected**: All components build successfully without manual intervention

### TC-2: Dependency Validation
**Scenario**: Verify all dependencies are properly specified
```bash
cargo clean
rm -rf node_modules
make build
```
**Expected**: Build succeeds with all dependencies fetched automatically

### TC-3: Container Build Test
**Scenario**: Build all container images
```bash
make build-containers
```
**Expected**: All 8 CLI container images build without errors

### TC-4: CI/CD Validation
**Scenario**: GitHub Actions workflow execution
```bash
act -j build-images
```
**Expected**: Workflow completes successfully with all checks passing

### TC-5: Cross-Platform Build
**Scenario**: Multi-architecture container builds
```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 infra/images/claude/
```
**Expected**: Images build successfully for both architectures

## Quality Gates

### Code Quality
- [ ] All Rust code passes `cargo clippy` with zero warnings
- [ ] TypeScript code compiles without errors
- [ ] All shell scripts pass shellcheck
- [ ] Dockerfiles follow hadolint best practices

### Performance
- [ ] Full project build completes in < 5 minutes
- [ ] Container image sizes are optimized (< 500MB per image)
- [ ] Build cache is properly utilized
- [ ] Parallel builds work correctly

### Documentation
- [ ] Each component has a README with setup instructions
- [ ] Architecture decisions are documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide exists
- [ ] Contributing guidelines are clear

## Edge Cases and Error Scenarios

### EC-1: Missing Dependencies
**Scenario**: Required system dependencies not installed
**Expected**: Clear error message with installation instructions

### EC-2: Network Connectivity Issues
**Scenario**: Unable to fetch dependencies due to network issues
**Expected**: Graceful failure with retry suggestions

### EC-3: Insufficient Permissions
**Scenario**: Docker daemon not accessible
**Expected**: Clear error message about permission requirements

### EC-4: Platform Incompatibility
**Scenario**: Attempting to build on unsupported platform
**Expected**: Early detection with helpful error message

## Definition of Done
Task 1 is considered complete when:
- [ ] All functional requirements are met and verified
- [ ] All non-functional requirements are satisfied
- [ ] All test cases pass
- [ ] Code quality gates are met
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Peer review has been completed
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs successfully
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities detected
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are met
- [ ] Project structure supports future CLI additions

## Rollback Criteria
If any of these conditions occur, the implementation should be rolled back:
- Build failure on supported platforms
- Security vulnerabilities detected
- Performance regression > 50%
- Incompatibility with existing systems
- Missing critical functionality
