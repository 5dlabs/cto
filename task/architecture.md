# Rust HTTP API Server Architecture

## Overview
A lightweight HTTP API server built in Rust demonstrating modern backend development practices. The application provides health checking, system information, and metrics endpoints with production-ready features.

## Architecture Components

### Core Dependencies
- **Tokio**: Async runtime for high-performance concurrent operations
- **Axum**: Modern HTTP framework with excellent ergonomics and performance
- **Serde**: JSON serialization/deserialization with compile-time guarantees
- **Tracing**: Structured logging with correlation IDs and observability

### Application Structure
```
src/
├── main.rs           # Application entry point and server setup
├── handlers.rs       # HTTP request handlers
├── models.rs         # Data structures and serialization
├── middleware.rs     # Request logging and error handling
├── metrics.rs        # Application metrics collection
└── errors.rs         # Custom error types and handling
```

### API Endpoints

#### `/health`
- **Purpose**: Health check endpoint for load balancers and monitoring
- **Method**: GET
- **Response**: JSON with status and timestamp
- **Use Case**: Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes

#### `/api/info`
- **Purpose**: Server information and runtime metrics
- **Method**: GET  
- **Response**: Version, uptime, build info, system status
- **Use Case**: Debugging, monitoring, version verification

#### `/metrics`
- **Purpose**: Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint
- **Method**: GET
- **Response**: Application metrics in standard format
- **Use Case**: Monitoring stack integration (Grafana, Prometheus)

## Key Design Decisions

### Error Handling
- Custom error types using `thiserror` for compile-time validation
- Consistent JSON error responses across all endpoints
- Error middleware for centralized error handling and logging

### Observability
- Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- Request/response timing and status code logging
- Comprehensive metrics collection (request counts, latencies, system resources)

### Performance
- Zero-copy JSON serialization where possible
- Efficient async request handling with Tokio
- Minimal memory allocations in hot paths
- Connection pooling for external dependencies

### Production Features
- Graceful shutdown handling for container environments
- Signal handling (SIGTERM/SIGINT) for clean shutdowns
- Resource cleanup and connection draining
- Docker multi-stage builds for minimal container size

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Handler function testing with mock data
- JSON serialization/deserialization validation
- Error handling scenarios and edge cases
- Custom error type behavior verification

### Integration Tests
- Full HTTP request/response cycle testing
- Endpoint behavior with real HTTP client
- Error response format validation
- Performance benchmarks for response times

### Code Quality
- `cargo clippy` for linting and best practices
- `cargo fmt` for consistent code formatting
- Comprehensive error handling coverage
- Memory safety guaranteed by Rust compiler

## Deployment Architecture

### Container Strategy
- Multi-stage Docker build for minimal production images
- Distroless base images for security and size optimization
- Non-root user execution for security
- Health check integration with container orchestration

### Configuration
- Environment-based configuration for different deployments
- Structured configuration validation at startup
- Graceful degradation for optional features
- Secret management through environment variables

### Monitoring Integration
- Structured logs compatible with log aggregation systems
- Metrics endpoint for Prometheus scraping
- Health endpoints for load balancer configuration
- Distributed tracing ready with correlation IDs

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
- `cargo run` for local server startup
- `cargo test` for comprehensive test suite
- `cargo clippy` for code quality validation
- Direct cargo development workflow

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass (`cargo test`)
- Zero clippy warnings (`cargo clippy`)
- Formatted code (`cargo fmt --check`)
- Documentation coverage for public APIs

This architecture provides a solid foundation for a production-ready Rust HTTP service with excellent performance characteristics, comprehensive observability, and modern development practices.
