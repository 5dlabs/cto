# Task ID: 50
# Title: Deployment Preparation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 49
# Priority: high
# Description: Prepare calculator for production deployment
# Details:
Choose hosting platform (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel), configure deployment settings, set up CI/CD if applicable, create deployment documentation, perform final production build

# Test Strategy:
Test deployment process works correctly, verify production URL is accessible, check all features work in production environment

# Subtasks:
## 1. Choose hosting platform [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Evaluate and select the most suitable hosting platform for the calculator application
### Details:
Compare GitHub Pages, Netlify, and Vercel based on ease of use, features, and requirements. Consider factors like custom domain support, SSL certificates, build process integration, and deployment simplicity. Document the chosen platform and rationale for selection.

## 2. Configure deployment settings [pending]
### Dependencies: 50.1
### Description: Set up and configure the chosen hosting platform with appropriate deployment settings
### Details:
Create account on chosen platform, connect repository if using Git-based deployment, configure build settings (if applicable), set up custom domain if needed, configure environment variables, ensure proper file paths and asset references for production environment.

## 3. Set up CI/CD [pending]
### Dependencies: 50.2
### Description: Implement continuous integration and deployment pipeline for automated deployments
### Details:
Configure automatic deployment triggers on main branch updates, set up build scripts in package.json if needed, create deployment configuration file (netlify.toml, vercel.json, or GitHub Actions workflow), implement pre-deployment checks, ensure deployment only occurs when tests pass.

## 4. Create deployment docs [pending]
### Dependencies: 50.3
### Description: Document the deployment process and configuration for future reference
### Details:
Create DEPLOYMENT.md file with step-by-step deployment instructions, document platform-specific settings and configurations, include troubleshooting section for common issues, add production URL and access information, document rollback procedures if deployment fails.

## 5. Deploy to production [pending]
### Dependencies: 50.4
### Description: Execute the deployment process and verify the calculator is live in production
### Details:
Run production build command to optimize assets, trigger deployment through chosen platform, monitor deployment logs for errors, verify production URL is accessible, test all calculator features in production environment, check console for any production-specific errors.
