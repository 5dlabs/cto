# Task ID: 29
# Title: Create Unit Tests Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up testing framework and create test file structure
# Details:
Create tests directory, set up simple test runner (can use vanilla JS or lightweight framework), create calculator.test.js file, implement basic test assertion functions, structure tests by functionality groups

# Test Strategy:
Verify test structure is created, ensure test runner can execute tests, check basic assertion functions work

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create test directory structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the tests directory with proper folder organization for unit tests, integration tests, and test utilities
### Details:
Create /tests directory at project root, add subdirectories for /unit, /integration, and /utils, create index.html as test runner page, add .gitkeep files to maintain empty directories

## 2. Set up test runner [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Implement a simple test runner system that can discover and execute test files
### Details:
Create testRunner.js with functions to load test files, execute test suites, track pass/fail results, display results in console and HTML, implement async test support

## 3. Create assertion utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Build assertion functions for testing including assertEqual, assertTrue, assertFalse, and assertThrows
### Details:
Create assertions.js in tests/utils with assertEqual(actual, expected), assertTrue(condition), assertFalse(condition), assertThrows(fn, errorType), include helpful error messages with actual vs expected values

## 4. Organize test suites [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.2, 29.3
### Description: Create test suite structure with describe() and it() functions for organizing related tests
### Details:
Implement describe(suiteName, callback) for grouping tests, create it(testName, callback) for individual tests, add beforeEach() and afterEach() hooks, support nested describe blocks

## 5. Create example tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.4
### Description: Write calculator.test.js with example tests demonstrating the testing framework usage
### Details:
Create tests for basic arithmetic operations, test display updates, verify button click handlers, demonstrate async test patterns, include at least 10 example test cases covering main calculator functionality
