# Task ID: 45
# Title: Performance Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 36
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct comprehensive performance testing
# Details:
Test rapid button clicking, measure JavaScript execution time, check memory usage over extended use, verify no performance degradation over time, test with browser dev tools

# Test Strategy:
Use performance profiling tools, create automated performance tests, document baseline performance metrics

# Subtasks:
## 1. Test rapid input scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Conduct stress testing with rapid button clicking and input sequences to identify performance bottlenecks
### Details:
Simulate rapid consecutive button clicks (100+ clicks/second), test quick calculation sequences, measure response time degradation, identify any UI freezing or lag, test with automated click scripts and manual rapid clicking

## 2. Profile JavaScript execution [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.1
### Description: Use browser developer tools to analyze JavaScript performance and identify optimization opportunities
### Details:
Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab, record calculation operations, analyze call stack and execution time, identify expensive functions, check for unnecessary re-renders or DOM manipulations, measure script evaluation time

## 3. Monitor memory usage [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.1, 45.2
### Description: Track memory consumption patterns during extended calculator use to detect potential memory leaks
### Details:
Use Chrome Memory Profiler, take heap snapshots before and after operations, monitor memory growth over 30+ minutes of use, check for detached DOM nodes, verify event listeners are properly cleaned up, test memory usage with 1000+ calculations

## 4. Create performance benchmarks [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.1, 45.2, 45.3
### Description: Establish baseline performance metrics and create automated benchmark tests for ongoing monitoring
### Details:
Document baseline metrics for operation speed, memory usage, and rendering time, create automated performance test suite, set acceptable thresholds for each metric, generate performance report template, implement performance regression detection
