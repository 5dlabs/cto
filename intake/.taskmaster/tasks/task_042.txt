# Task ID: 42
# Title: Implement Percentage Calculation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 20
# Priority: low
# Description: Add percentage button and calculation functionality
# Details:
Add % button to calculator layout, implement percentage calculation (divide by 100), handle percentage in context of operations (e.g., 50 + 10% = 55), update display appropriately

# Test Strategy:
Test percentage calculations in isolation, verify percentage works with operations, check edge cases

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add percentage button to calculator layout [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add a % button to the calculator interface in an appropriate position
### Details:
Add percentage button element to HTML, position it logically (near operators or special functions), apply consistent styling to match other calculator buttons, ensure button has proper ID for event handling

## 2. Implement basic percentage calculation logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 42.1
### Description: Create core percentage calculation functionality that divides by 100
### Details:
Create handlePercentage() function, implement basic logic to divide current value by 100, update calculator state with percentage result, call updateDisplay() to show the result

## 3. Handle contextual percentage operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 42.2
### Description: Implement percentage calculations in context of mathematical operations
### Details:
Detect when percentage is used with an operation (e.g., 50 + 10%), calculate percentage relative to first operand (10% of 50 = 5), apply the operation with calculated percentage value (50 + 5 = 55), handle all four basic operations with percentages

## 4. Test percentage functionality scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 42.3
### Description: Thoroughly test all percentage calculation use cases and edge cases
### Details:
Test standalone percentage (25% = 0.25), test percentage with addition (100 + 10% = 110), test percentage with subtraction (100 - 10% = 90), test percentage with multiplication and division, verify edge cases like 0% and negative percentages
