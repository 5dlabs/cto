# Task ID: 48
# Title: Security Review
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 28
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct security review and implement best practices
# Details:
Sanitize any user inputs, implement Content Security Policy headers, ensure no eval() or innerHTML usage, check for XSS vulnerabilities, validate all calculations server-side if needed

# Test Strategy:
Run security scanning tools, attempt common XSS attacks, verify CSP headers are set correctly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit input handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review all user input points and ensure proper sanitization is implemented
### Details:
Identify all places where user input is processed (button clicks, keyboard input), verify no direct innerHTML usage, check for proper input validation, ensure all inputs are sanitized before display, review event handlers for security issues

## 2. Implement CSP headers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add Content Security Policy headers to prevent XSS attacks
### Details:
Create appropriate CSP header configuration, restrict inline scripts and styles, define allowed sources for scripts/styles/fonts, implement CSP meta tag in HTML head, test CSP implementation doesn't break functionality

## 3. Check for vulnerabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 48.1
### Description: Perform manual security audit for common web vulnerabilities
### Details:
Check for XSS vulnerabilities in display updates, verify no eval() or Function() constructor usage, ensure no dynamic script injection, validate all DOM manipulation is safe, review third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities

## 4. Run security scans [pending]
### Dependencies: 48.2, 48.3
### Description: Execute automated security scanning tools and penetration tests
### Details:
Run OWASP ZAP or similar security scanner, perform basic XSS attack attempts, test CSP headers with online validators, check for console errors or warnings, verify security headers are properly set

## 5. Document findings [pending]
### Dependencies: 48.4
### Description: Create comprehensive security audit report with findings and remediations
### Details:
Document all security measures implemented, list any vulnerabilities found and fixed, create security best practices guide for future development, document CSP policy and rationale, provide testing procedures for security verification
