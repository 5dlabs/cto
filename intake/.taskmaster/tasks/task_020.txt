# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Basic Calculation Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Create function to perform arithmetic calculations
# Details:
Create calculate() function that takes two numbers and an operation, implement switch statement for +, -, *, / operations, handle division by zero with error message, return calculated result as string, ensure proper number precision

# Test Strategy:
Test all four operations with various inputs, verify division by zero handling, check precision of results

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create calculate function structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic calculate() function that accepts two numbers and an operation parameter
### Details:
Define function signature as calculate(num1, num2, operation), validate input parameters are numbers, set up switch statement structure for operations, return result as string

## 2. Implement arithmetic operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Add cases for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in the switch statement
### Details:
Implement case '+' for addition, case '-' for subtraction, case '*' for multiplication, case '/' for division, include default case for invalid operations

## 3. Handle division by zero [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2
### Description: Add special handling for division by zero to prevent errors and show appropriate message
### Details:
Check if divisor is zero before division operation, return 'Error' or 'Cannot divide by zero' message, ensure error state is handled properly in display

## 4. Manage number precision [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2
### Description: Implement logic to handle floating point precision issues and limit decimal places
### Details:
Use parseFloat and toFixed for precision control, handle very small numbers close to zero, prevent floating point errors like 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004, limit to reasonable decimal places (8-10)

## 5. Format results appropriately [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3, 20.4
### Description: Format the calculation results for display, removing unnecessary decimals and handling edge cases
### Details:
Remove trailing zeros after decimal point, convert very large numbers to exponential notation if needed, ensure result fits within display constraints, handle special cases like Infinity or NaN
