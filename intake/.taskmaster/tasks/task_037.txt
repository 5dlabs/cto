# Task ID: 37
# Title: Add Touch Event Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement touch events for better mobile experience
# Details:
Add touchstart events alongside click events, prevent default touch behaviors that interfere, add touch feedback with :active states, handle touch event delays

# Test Strategy:
Test on actual touch devices, verify no double-firing of events, ensure responsive touch feedback

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add touchstart event handlers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add touchstart event listeners alongside existing click handlers for all calculator buttons
### Details:
Iterate through all calculator buttons and add touchstart event listeners that trigger the same functionality as click events. Ensure event handlers are properly bound and don't cause double-firing when both touch and click events are triggered.

## 2. Prevent default touch behaviors [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.1
### Description: Prevent unwanted default touch behaviors that interfere with calculator functionality
### Details:
Add preventDefault() calls to touch event handlers to stop default behaviors like text selection, zooming, or context menus. Handle touch event delays by using touchstart instead of touchend where appropriate.

## 3. Implement touch feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.2
### Description: Add visual feedback for touch interactions using CSS :active states
### Details:
Enhance CSS with :active pseudo-class styles for all interactive elements. Add appropriate transitions or color changes to provide immediate visual feedback when buttons are touched. Ensure feedback is noticeable but not jarring.

## 4. Test on real devices [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.3
### Description: Thoroughly test touch functionality on actual mobile devices
### Details:
Test on various touch devices (phones, tablets) with different operating systems. Verify no double-firing of events occurs, touch feedback is responsive, and all calculator functions work correctly via touch. Document any device-specific issues found.
