# Task ID: 36
# Title: Optimize Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 32
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize JavaScript and CSS for better performance
# Details:
Minimize DOM queries by caching elements, use event delegation for button clicks, optimize CSS selectors, remove unused CSS, ensure no memory leaks in event listeners

# Test Strategy:
Use browser dev tools to profile performance, verify no memory leaks occur, test on lower-end devices

# Subtasks:
## 1. Cache DOM element references [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Store frequently accessed DOM elements in variables to minimize repeated queries
### Details:
Create a DOMCache object to store references to display element, buttons container, and all calculator buttons. Initialize cache on page load and use cached references throughout the application instead of repeated querySelector calls

## 2. Implement event delegation [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.1
### Description: Replace individual button event listeners with a single delegated listener on the buttons container
### Details:
Remove all individual button click listeners and implement a single event listener on the buttons container. Use event.target to determine which button was clicked and route to appropriate handler function based on data attributes

## 3. Optimize CSS selectors [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review and optimize all CSS selectors for better performance
### Details:
Replace descendant selectors with more specific class selectors, avoid universal selectors, minimize selector depth, use ID selectors where appropriate for unique elements, and ensure selectors read right-to-left efficiently

## 4. Remove unused code [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.3
### Description: Identify and remove any unused CSS rules, JavaScript functions, and commented code
### Details:
Use browser dev tools coverage tab to identify unused CSS and JavaScript, remove any commented-out code blocks, eliminate redundant functions, and clean up any experimental code that isn't being used in production

## 5. Profile and fix memory leaks [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.2, 36.4
### Description: Use browser profiling tools to identify and fix any memory leaks in the application
### Details:
Use Chrome DevTools Memory Profiler to take heap snapshots, identify detached DOM nodes and event listeners, ensure all event listeners are properly removed when not needed, verify no circular references exist, and test memory usage during extended calculator use
