# Task ID: 35
# Title: Add Memory Functions Preparation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: low
# Description: Prepare infrastructure for potential memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)
# Details:
Add memory variable to state, create placeholder functions for memory operations, add comments for future implementation, ensure current functionality isn't affected

# Test Strategy:
Verify placeholder code doesn't interfere with current operations, ensure code structure supports easy addition of memory features

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add memory state variable [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add a memory variable to the calculator's state management to store memory values
### Details:
Add 'let memory = 0;' alongside other state variables (currentNumber, previousNumber, operation). Initialize to 0 to represent empty memory. Ensure variable is accessible to future memory functions.

## 2. Create placeholder memory functions [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1
### Description: Create empty function declarations for all memory operations (M+, M-, MR, MC)
### Details:
Create four placeholder functions: memoryAdd(), memorySubtract(), memoryRecall(), and memoryClear(). Each function should have a comment indicating future implementation. Functions should be empty but properly declared to avoid errors.

## 3. Document future implementation approach [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.2
### Description: Add comprehensive comments documenting how memory functions will be implemented
### Details:
Add detailed comments above each placeholder function explaining: expected behavior (M+ adds current to memory, M- subtracts, MR recalls, MC clears), when buttons will be added to UI, how functions will interact with display and state, any edge cases to consider.
