# Task ID: 35
# Title: Optimize Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize calculator for better performance
# Details:
Minimize DOM queries by caching elements, debounce rapid button clicks if needed, optimize event listeners using delegation, minimize reflows and repaints, profile and fix any performance bottlenecks

# Test Strategy:
Use browser dev tools to profile performance, test with rapid input sequences, verify no lag or delays

# Subtasks:
## 1. Cache DOM queries [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Store frequently accessed DOM elements in variables to minimize repeated queries
### Details:
Identify all DOM elements accessed multiple times (display, buttons container, individual buttons), create a DOMCache object to store references, initialize cache on page load, replace all getElementById/querySelector calls with cached references, ensure cache is populated before any operations

## 2. Implement event delegation [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1
### Description: Replace individual button event listeners with a single delegated listener on the buttons container
### Details:
Remove all individual button click listeners, add single event listener to buttons container, use event.target to identify clicked button, implement switch statement or lookup table for button actions, ensure special buttons (clear, equals, operators) are handled correctly

## 3. Minimize reflows/repaints [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1, 35.2
### Description: Optimize DOM manipulation to reduce browser reflow and repaint operations
### Details:
Batch DOM updates where possible, use documentFragment for multiple element additions, avoid reading layout properties immediately after writes, minimize style changes during calculations, use CSS transforms instead of position changes where applicable

## 4. Profile performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1, 35.2, 35.3
### Description: Use browser developer tools to identify and measure performance bottlenecks
### Details:
Record performance profile during typical usage, analyze flame charts for slow functions, check for excessive garbage collection, measure frame rates during rapid input, identify any memory leaks or growing memory usage, document baseline metrics

## 5. Apply optimizations [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.4
### Description: Implement targeted optimizations based on profiling results
### Details:
Debounce rapid button clicks if needed, optimize calculation algorithms, implement requestAnimationFrame for display updates if beneficial, lazy load non-critical resources, minify and compress assets, verify improvements with before/after metrics
