# Task ID: 46
# Title: Security Review
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 42
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct security review of the application
# Details:
Verify no eval() or innerHTML usage, check for XSS vulnerabilities, ensure no sensitive data exposure, validate all inputs are properly sanitized, review Content Security Policy needs

# Test Strategy:
Use security scanning tools, attempt common attack vectors, verify all user inputs are safe

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit code for security vulnerabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform comprehensive code review to identify potential security issues
### Details:
Review all JavaScript code for dangerous patterns like eval(), innerHTML usage, or other code injection risks. Check for proper error handling, secure data storage practices, and any hardcoded sensitive information. Examine event handlers for potential security issues.

## 2. Test XSS attack vectors [pending]
### Dependencies: 46.1
### Description: Attempt common XSS attacks to verify application security
### Details:
Test various XSS payloads in all input fields and display areas. Try script injection through button clicks, keyboard inputs, and any user-controllable data. Verify that special characters are properly escaped and that no JavaScript can be executed through user input.

## 3. Validate input sanitization [pending]
### Dependencies: 46.2
### Description: Ensure all user inputs are properly sanitized and validated
### Details:
Verify that all calculator inputs are restricted to valid characters only (numbers and operators). Check that input length limits are enforced. Ensure special characters and HTML entities are properly handled. Test edge cases like very long inputs or unusual character combinations.

## 4. Review CSP requirements [pending]
### Dependencies: 46.3
### Description: Analyze and document Content Security Policy needs for the application
### Details:
Determine appropriate CSP headers for the calculator application. Document which directives are needed (script-src, style-src, etc.). Create recommended CSP configuration that prevents inline scripts and external resource loading. Test application functionality with strict CSP rules applied.
