# Task ID: 46
# Title: Add Integration Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 30, 31, 32
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create end-to-end tests for complete user workflows
# Details:
Test complete calculation workflows, test error scenarios end-to-end, verify all buttons work in sequence, test keyboard and mouse interactions together, automate common user patterns

# Test Strategy:
Run through all user stories as tests, verify no broken workflows, check edge case handling

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up E2E test framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure end-to-end testing framework with necessary dependencies and test runner configuration
### Details:
Install Cypress or Playwright as E2E testing framework, configure test runner with appropriate settings for browser testing, set up test directory structure with folders for fixtures and support files, create base configuration for running tests in different browsers, implement helper functions for common test actions like clicking buttons and reading display values

## 2. Test calculation workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: 46.1
### Description: Create comprehensive tests for all mathematical operation workflows including basic and complex calculations
### Details:
Test basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), verify decimal number calculations work correctly, test chained operations and order of operations, validate memory functions if implemented, ensure percentage calculations produce correct results, test edge cases like division by zero

## 3. Test error scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 46.1
### Description: Implement tests for error handling and edge cases throughout the application
### Details:
Test division by zero displays appropriate error message, verify overflow handling for very large numbers, test invalid input sequences and their handling, check error recovery after encountering errors, validate that Clear button properly resets after errors, ensure error messages are user-friendly and informative

## 4. Test UI interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 46.1
### Description: Create tests for all user interface interactions including keyboard and mouse events
### Details:
Test all button clicks register correctly on display, verify keyboard input works for numbers and operations, test keyboard shortcuts like Enter for equals and Escape for clear, validate focus management and tab navigation, ensure responsive design works across different viewport sizes, test touch events on mobile devices

## 5. Automate test runs [pending]
### Dependencies: 46.1, 46.2, 46.3, 46.4
### Description: Set up automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline and local development workflow
### Details:
Configure npm scripts for running E2E tests locally, set up GitHub Actions or similar CI tool to run tests on push, implement test reporting with screenshots on failures, configure parallel test execution for faster runs, set up test coverage reporting, create pre-commit hooks to run critical tests before code commits
