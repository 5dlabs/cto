# Task ID: 47
# Title: Performance Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 35
# Priority: low
# Description: Conduct thorough performance testing and optimization
# Details:
Measure initial load time, test with throttled network/CPU, check memory usage over time, verify no memory leaks, optimize any bottlenecks found

# Test Strategy:
Use Lighthouse for performance audit, monitor memory usage in dev tools, test on low-end devices

# Subtasks:
## 1. Measure Initial Load Times [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Measure and document baseline performance metrics for initial page load
### Details:
Use Lighthouse to run performance audit, measure First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Time to Interactive (TTI), and Total Blocking Time (TBT). Document baseline metrics for comparison. Test on both desktop and mobile views.

## 2. Test with Network and CPU Throttling [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.1
### Description: Simulate low-end device conditions and slow network connections
### Details:
Use Chrome DevTools to test with Slow 3G, Fast 3G network throttling. Apply 4x and 6x CPU slowdown. Test calculator responsiveness during rapid button clicks. Verify all operations complete without timeout or lag.

## 3. Monitor Memory Usage Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.1
### Description: Profile memory consumption during extended calculator usage
### Details:
Use Chrome DevTools Memory Profiler to take heap snapshots. Monitor memory usage during 5-10 minutes of continuous calculator operations. Check for DOM node count growth. Document memory consumption patterns and identify any unusual spikes.

## 4. Check for Memory Leaks [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.3
### Description: Verify no memory leaks exist in event handlers and object references
### Details:
Perform allocation timeline recording during repeated operations. Check for detached DOM nodes and unreleased event listeners. Verify garbage collection properly cleans up objects. Test memory behavior after 100+ calculations.

## 5. Optimize Performance Findings [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.1, 47.2, 47.3, 47.4
### Description: Implement optimizations based on performance testing results
### Details:
Apply performance improvements for any identified bottlenecks. Optimize render-blocking resources, implement lazy loading if applicable, minimize JavaScript execution time. Re-run Lighthouse audit to verify improvements meet performance budget targets.
