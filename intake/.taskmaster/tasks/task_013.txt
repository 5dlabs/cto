# Task ID: 13
# Title: Define Calculator State Variables
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Create variables to track calculator state including current number, previous number, and operation
# Details:
Define variables: let currentNumber = '0', let previousNumber = '', let operation = null, let shouldResetDisplay = false, create const for display element reference

# Test Strategy:
Verify all variables are properly initialized, ensure they're accessible within the calculator scope, test that display element is correctly referenced

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define number-related state variables [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create variables to track the current number being entered and the previous number for calculations
### Details:
Define let currentNumber = '0' to store the number currently being entered or displayed. Define let previousNumber = '' to store the first operand when performing calculations. Ensure both variables are initialized with appropriate default values and are accessible within the calculator's scope.

## 2. Define operation state variables [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create variables to track the current operation and display reset state
### Details:
Define let operation = null to store the current mathematical operation (+, -, *, /). Define let shouldResetDisplay = false to track whether the display should be cleared on the next number input. These variables will manage the calculator's operational state between button presses.

## 3. Create DOM element references [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Create constant reference to the calculator display element for efficient DOM manipulation
### Details:
Define const display = document.getElementById('display') to create a reference to the display element. This constant will be used throughout the application to update the calculator's display. Ensure the reference is created after the DOM is fully loaded to avoid null references.
