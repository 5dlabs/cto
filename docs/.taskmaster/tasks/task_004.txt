# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Solana RPC Connection Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a robust RPC connection management system with fallback endpoints, retry logic, and connection pooling
# Details:
Implement RPC client wrapper using @solana/web3.js Connection class. Configure multiple RPC endpoints (mainnet-beta, devnet) with automatic fallback. Add exponential backoff retry logic for failed requests. Implement connection health monitoring. Create request batching for efficiency. Add WebSocket support for real-time updates. Cache frequently accessed data with TTL.

# Test Strategy:
Test failover between RPC endpoints, verify retry logic under network failures, load test connection pooling, validate WebSocket reconnection, test cache invalidation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create RPC client wrapper class [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a TypeScript class that wraps the @solana/web3.js Connection class with enhanced functionality for managing RPC connections
### Details:
Create RPCClient class extending or wrapping Connection. Add constructor to accept configuration options. Implement base methods for common RPC operations (getBalance, getTransaction, etc.). Add error handling and logging infrastructure. Create interfaces for configuration and response types. Setup connection timeout and request ID tracking.

## 2. Implement multi-endpoint configuration with fallback logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Configure multiple RPC endpoints and implement automatic fallback mechanism when primary endpoints fail
### Details:
Create endpoint configuration structure supporting mainnet-beta, devnet, and custom RPCs. Implement endpoint priority system and health scoring. Build fallback logic to switch endpoints on failure. Add endpoint rotation for load distribution. Configure endpoint-specific settings (rate limits, timeouts). Implement endpoint selection strategy based on latency and reliability.

## 3. Add exponential backoff retry mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Implement intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff for failed RPC requests
### Details:
Create retry configuration with max attempts, initial delay, and backoff multiplier. Implement exponential backoff algorithm with jitter. Add request-specific retry policies. Handle different error types appropriately (network vs rate limit). Implement circuit breaker pattern for failing endpoints. Add retry metrics and logging.

## 4. Implement connection health monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Build a health monitoring system that tracks RPC endpoint performance and availability
### Details:
Create health check service with periodic ping tests. Implement latency tracking for each endpoint. Monitor success/failure rates and response times. Build endpoint scoring algorithm based on health metrics. Add automatic endpoint disabling for unhealthy nodes. Create health status dashboard/API. Implement alerting for degraded performance.

## 5. Create request batching system [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.3
### Description: Implement request batching to optimize RPC calls and reduce network overhead
### Details:
Build request queue with configurable batch size and timeout. Implement JSON-RPC 2.0 batch request formatting. Create request aggregation logic for similar calls. Handle batch response parsing and error distribution. Optimize batch sizing based on endpoint limits. Add priority queuing for time-sensitive requests. Implement batch request deduplication.

## 6. Add WebSocket support for real-time updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Implement WebSocket connections for real-time data subscriptions and updates
### Details:
Create WebSocket connection manager with auto-reconnect. Implement subscription management for account, slot, and program updates. Handle WebSocket message parsing and event distribution. Add connection state management and error recovery. Implement subscription deduplication and cleanup. Create event emitter for subscription updates. Add WebSocket connection pooling.

## 7. Implement caching layer with TTL [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.5
### Description: Build a caching system with time-to-live support for frequently accessed data
### Details:
Create cache storage interface supporting memory and Redis backends. Implement cache key generation for different request types. Add TTL configuration per data type (accounts, transactions, etc.). Build cache invalidation strategies. Implement cache warming for critical data. Add cache hit/miss metrics. Create cache size management with LRU eviction.

## 8. Add connection pooling and load balancing [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.4, 4.6
### Description: Implement connection pooling to manage multiple concurrent connections and distribute load across endpoints
### Details:
Create connection pool with configurable size limits. Implement connection lifecycle management (create, reuse, destroy). Build load balancing algorithms (round-robin, least-connections, weighted). Add connection health tracking within pool. Implement request routing based on endpoint capabilities. Create pool statistics and monitoring. Add graceful shutdown handling for pool cleanup.
