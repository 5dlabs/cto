# Task ID: 23
# Title: Setup Workflow Archival
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement workflow archival and cleanup policies for completed workflows
# Details:
Configure Argo Workflows artifact repository (S3/MinIO) for workflow archival. Set TTL for completed workflows (30 days). Implement workflow GC (garbage collection) policies. Archive workflow logs and artifacts before deletion. Create workflow history API for querying archived workflows. Implement compliance-based retention policies. Consider using Workflow Archive for long-term storage.

# Test Strategy:
Verify workflows archived after completion. Test artifact storage and retrieval. Validate TTL-based cleanup. Test GC doesn't delete active workflows. Verify archived workflow queryability. Test restoration from archive.
