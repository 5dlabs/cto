# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Solana Wallet Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate wallet connectivity for Phantom, Solflare, and other major Solana wallets to enable user authentication and transaction signing
# Details:
Use @solana/wallet-adapter libraries to implement multi-wallet support. Create WalletProvider component for React integration. Implement connection management with auto-reconnect logic. Handle wallet events (connect, disconnect, account change). Store wallet state in context/state management. Implement transaction signing flow with proper error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Test wallet connection/disconnection flows, verify transaction signing with test transactions, test error scenarios (rejected transactions, network issues), validate wallet switching

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Configure Wallet Adapter Libraries [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up @solana/wallet-adapter packages and configure the necessary dependencies for multi-wallet support
### Details:
Install @solana/wallet-adapter-react, @solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui, @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets, and @solana/wallet-adapter-base. Configure TypeScript types and module resolution. Set up wallet adapter styles and theme customization. Install specific wallet adapters for Phantom, Solflare, Backpack, and other major wallets.

## 2. Create WalletProvider Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Build a React component that wraps the application with wallet adapter context and provides multi-wallet support
### Details:
Create WalletProvider component using WalletProvider from @solana/wallet-adapter-react. Configure supported wallets array including Phantom, Solflare, Backpack, Ledger, and others. Set up network configuration (mainnet-beta, devnet). Implement custom wallet modal UI or use default WalletModalProvider. Add wallet adapter configuration options.

## 3. Implement Connection Management Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Build robust connection management system with auto-reconnect capabilities and connection state tracking
### Details:
Implement auto-connect on page load if previously connected. Create reconnection logic with exponential backoff for network failures. Add connection state persistence in localStorage. Implement connection timeout handling. Create hooks for connection status monitoring. Add network switching capabilities.

## 4. Handle Wallet Events [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Set up comprehensive event handling for all wallet state changes and user interactions
### Details:
Implement event listeners for wallet connect, disconnect, and account change events. Create handlers for wallet ready state changes. Add listeners for wallet errors and warnings. Implement account change detection and handling. Create event logging for debugging. Handle wallet adapter specific events.

## 5. Implement Wallet State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Create a centralized state management system for wallet data using React Context or state management library
### Details:
Create WalletContext with wallet state (connected, publicKey, balance). Implement custom hooks (useWallet, useConnection) for easy access. Add wallet metadata storage (wallet name, icon, adapter). Create actions for wallet operations. Implement state persistence across page refreshes. Add derived state for wallet status indicators.

## 6. Build Transaction Signing Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Implement secure transaction creation, signing, and submission flow with proper user confirmation
### Details:
Create transaction builder utilities for common operations. Implement transaction simulation before signing. Add user confirmation modal with transaction details. Build signing request handler with timeout. Implement transaction status tracking. Add support for versioned transactions. Create utilities for fee estimation.

## 7. Add Comprehensive Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.6
### Description: Implement robust error handling for all wallet operations with user-friendly error messages
### Details:
Create error boundary for wallet-related components. Implement specific error handlers for common wallet errors (rejected transaction, insufficient balance, network error). Add user-friendly error messages and recovery suggestions. Create error logging system. Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors. Add fallback UI for wallet connection failures.
