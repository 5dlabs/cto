# Task ID: 7
# Title: Build Trading Execution Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core trading engine that can execute swaps through integrated DEXs with optimal routing
# Details:
Implement swap execution using Jupiter API for aggregated routing. Build transaction construction with proper compute units and priority fees. Add pre-flight simulation for transaction validation. Implement slippage protection and MEV protection. Create transaction status tracking. Handle partial fills and failed transactions. Add transaction retry logic with updated blockhash.

# Test Strategy:
Test swap execution on devnet first, verify slippage protection works, test transaction retry logic, validate compute unit optimization, test various token pairs and amounts

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Jupiter swap execution [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate Jupiter aggregator API to execute token swaps with optimal routing across multiple DEXs
### Details:
Set up Jupiter SDK integration and configure API endpoints. Implement quote fetching with route optimization. Build swap instruction generation using Jupiter's computed routes. Handle token account validation and creation if needed. Implement proper error handling for API failures and rate limits.

## 2. Build transaction construction with compute units [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create transaction builder that properly sets compute unit limits and budgets for optimal execution
### Details:
Implement dynamic compute unit calculation based on transaction complexity. Build transaction instruction ordering for optimal execution. Add compute budget instructions with proper limits. Implement transaction size validation to stay within limits. Create helper functions for common transaction patterns.

## 3. Add priority fee optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Implement dynamic priority fee calculation to ensure timely transaction execution
### Details:
Integrate with RPC methods to fetch recent priority fees. Implement fee estimation based on network congestion. Build adaptive fee adjustment based on transaction urgency. Create configurable fee strategies (fast, normal, slow). Add maximum fee limits to prevent overpaying.

## 4. Implement pre-flight simulation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Build transaction simulation system to validate trades before submission
### Details:
Implement simulateTransaction RPC calls for validation. Parse simulation results to detect potential failures. Validate token balances and allowances before execution. Check for common error conditions like insufficient SOL for fees. Create detailed error messages for simulation failures.

## 5. Add slippage protection mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.4
### Description: Implement configurable slippage tolerance to protect users from unfavorable price movements
### Details:
Build slippage calculation based on quoted vs expected amounts. Implement minimum output amount validation. Create configurable slippage tolerance settings. Add automatic slippage adjustment based on liquidity. Implement price impact warnings for large trades.

## 6. Implement MEV protection [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3, 7.5
### Description: Add mechanisms to protect transactions from MEV attacks and sandwich trades
### Details:
Implement transaction privacy features using commitment levels. Add random transaction timing within acceptable windows. Build sandwich attack detection based on mempool analysis. Implement partial fill strategies to reduce MEV exposure. Create monitoring for suspicious transaction patterns.

## 7. Create transaction status tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Build comprehensive system to track transaction lifecycle from submission to confirmation
### Details:
Implement WebSocket subscriptions for transaction status updates. Create transaction state machine (pending, processing, confirmed, failed). Build timeout handling for stuck transactions. Implement confirmation counting with configurable thresholds. Add transaction history logging with detailed status changes.

## 8. Handle partial fills and failures [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.7
### Description: Implement robust handling for partially executed trades and transaction failures
### Details:
Build partial fill detection from transaction logs. Implement remainder order handling for unfilled amounts. Create failure categorization (insufficient funds, slippage, network errors). Build automatic refund detection and processing. Implement user notifications for partial fills and failures.

## 9. Add retry logic with blockhash updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.7, 7.8
### Description: Implement intelligent retry mechanism with fresh blockhashes for failed transactions
### Details:
Build blockhash management with automatic refresh. Implement exponential backoff for retry attempts. Create retry strategies based on failure types. Add maximum retry limits with user notifications. Implement transaction deduplication to prevent double execution.
