# Task ID: 28
# Title: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for long-running multi-agent workflows
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 15, 22, 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build a robust monitoring system for multi-agent workflows that run over extended periods (days/weeks), including health checks, stuck workflow detection, resource tracking, and automated cleanup strategies for completed workflows.
# Details:
Develop a comprehensive monitoring solution addressing operational concerns for long-running multi-agent workflows:

1. **Health Check System**:
   - Implement Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes for agent pods with custom health endpoints
   - Create workflow heartbeat mechanism using Argo Workflows metrics (workflow.status.progress)
   - Deploy synthetic health check workflows every 6 hours to verify system functionality
   - Implement dead letter queue pattern for failed health checks
   - Use Prometheus BlackBox exporter for external endpoint monitoring

2. **Stuck Workflow Detection**:
   - Configure Prometheus alerts for workflows stuck at same stage >6 hours (customizable per stage)
   - Implement workflow age monitoring with graduated thresholds (warning at 7 days, critical at 10 days)
   - Create AlertManager rules with PagerDuty/Slack integration for critical stuck workflows
   - Build automatic workflow annotation with stuck reason analysis using controller logs
   - Implement workflow recovery suggestions based on stuck patterns

3. **Resource Consumption Tracking**:
   - Deploy Kubernetes Metrics Server and collect pod-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O)
   - Implement PVC usage monitoring with alerts at 80% capacity
   - Track GitHub API rate limits per agent using custom metrics
   - Monitor network egress for cost optimization
   - Create resource usage forecasting using historical data
   - Implement cost allocation tags for multi-tenant scenarios

4. **Automated Cleanup Strategies**:
   - Configure graduated cleanup policies: active (no cleanup), completed (7 days), failed (3 days), stuck (14 days)
   - Implement workflow archival to S3/MinIO before deletion with compression
   - Create cleanup exemption mechanism via workflow annotations
   - Build PVC cleanup for orphaned volumes using CronJob
   - Implement log aggregation to centralized storage before pod deletion
   - Create compliance-aware retention policies (30 days minimum for audit)

5. **Monitoring Infrastructure**:
   - Extend existing Grafana dashboards with long-running workflow panels
   - Create SLO/SLI definitions: 99% workflow completion rate, <1% stuck rate
   - Implement distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry for cross-agent correlation
   - Build workflow timeline visualization showing all stage transitions
   - Create agent performance comparison dashboard (Rex vs Cleo vs Tess)

6. **Alerting Configuration**:
   - Define alert severity levels: P1 (workflow stuck >24h), P2 (resource exhaustion), P3 (health check failures)
   - Implement alert suppression during maintenance windows
   - Create runbook automation for common issues (restart stuck workflow, cleanup PVC)
   - Build alert correlation to reduce noise from cascading failures

7. **Operational Tools**:
   - Create kubectl plugin for workflow diagnostics: 'kubectl workflow-health'
   - Implement workflow pause/resume CLI for maintenance
   - Build bulk workflow operations API (pause all, cleanup completed)
   - Create workflow migration tool for controller upgrades

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive testing approach for monitoring and alerting system:

1. **Health Check Validation**:
   - Deploy test workflow and verify health checks report correctly
   - Simulate agent pod crashes and confirm detection within 5 minutes
   - Test synthetic workflow execution and metric collection
   - Validate health check endpoints return proper HTTP status codes

2. **Stuck Workflow Testing**:
   - Create workflow with artificial suspension >6 hours
   - Verify Prometheus alert fires with correct labels
   - Test AlertManager routing to appropriate channels
   - Validate stuck reason analysis captures root cause
   - Test recovery suggestions for common stuck patterns

3. **Resource Monitoring Verification**:
   - Run resource-intensive workflow and verify metrics collection
   - Test PVC usage alerts at 80% threshold
   - Validate GitHub API rate limit tracking
   - Verify resource forecasting with historical data
   - Test cost allocation tag propagation

4. **Cleanup Strategy Testing**:
   - Create workflows in various states (completed, failed, stuck)
   - Verify cleanup occurs at configured intervals
   - Test archival to S3/MinIO with retrieval
   - Validate cleanup exemption via annotations
   - Test PVC orphan detection and cleanup
   - Verify compliance retention policies enforced

5. **Load Testing**:
   - Run 100+ concurrent workflows for 72 hours
   - Monitor system stability and resource consumption
   - Verify no metric collection gaps
   - Test alert storm suppression
   - Validate dashboard performance with high cardinality

6. **Failure Scenario Testing**:
   - Simulate Prometheus outage and verify fallback monitoring
   - Test AlertManager failure and backup notification paths
   - Validate monitoring resilience during controller restarts
   - Test recovery from S3/MinIO unavailability

7. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify end-to-end alert flow from detection to notification
   - Test runbook automation for common scenarios
   - Validate distributed tracing across multiple agents
   - Test bulk operations under various workflow states
