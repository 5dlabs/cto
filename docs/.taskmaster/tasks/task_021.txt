# Task ID: 21
# Title: Create End-to-End Testing Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive E2E tests covering entire multi-agent workflow from trigger to completion
# Details:
Create test scenarios: happy path, feedback loops, agent failures, concurrent tasks. Use GitHub API to create test PRs and events. Implement workflow assertions using Argo CLI or API. Test with synthetic tasks of varying complexity. Measure end-to-end latency and identify bottlenecks. Create chaos testing scenarios (pod failures, network issues). Use property-based testing for event correlation logic.

# Test Strategy:
Run full workflow with test tasks. Verify each stage completes correctly. Test feedback loops with multiple iterations. Validate performance under load. Test recovery from various failure modes. Monitor for race conditions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Comprehensive Test Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create detailed test scenarios covering happy path workflows, multi-iteration feedback loops, agent failure recovery, and concurrent task execution patterns
### Details:
Define test cases for: successful end-to-end flow with Rex/Blaze/Tess agents, feedback loop scenarios with 3+ iterations, agent timeout and failure recovery, concurrent PR processing, workflow suspension/resume cycles, edge cases like malformed webhooks and missing labels. Document expected outcomes and assertions for each scenario.

## 2. Implement GitHub API Test Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Build test harness for creating synthetic PRs, labels, reviews, and webhook events using GitHub API to simulate real workflow triggers
### Details:
Create test utilities for: generating test repositories and PRs with configurable labels (task-*), simulating PR review events and status updates, creating webhook payloads matching production format, managing test data cleanup after runs. Implement rate limiting handling and API authentication. Support both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise.

## 3. Develop Argo Workflow Assertion Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Create assertion library using Argo CLI/API to verify workflow state transitions, suspension points, and completion status
### Details:
Build assertions for: workflow creation and initialization, correct stage transitions (rex -> blaze -> tess), suspension state verification at each stage, label selector validation (workflow-type, task-id, current-stage), parameter passing between stages, workflow completion and artifact validation. Implement retry logic for eventual consistency.

## 4. Build Synthetic Task Generator [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2
### Description: Create configurable task generators producing varying complexity levels to stress-test the multi-agent system under different loads
### Details:
Generate tasks with: simple code changes (single file edits), complex refactoring (multi-file changes), test generation requirements, varying PR sizes (10-1000 lines), different language contexts (Python, Go, TypeScript). Support configurable complexity levels and task distribution patterns. Include realistic code patterns from production usage.

## 5. Implement Chaos Testing Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.3
### Description: Develop chaos engineering tests simulating pod failures, network partitions, and resource exhaustion to validate system resilience
### Details:
Implement chaos scenarios: random pod termination during agent execution, network delays between Argo and agents, CPU/memory resource limits triggering OOM, EventSource/Sensor failures and restarts, Victoria Metrics unavailability, GitHub API rate limiting. Use tools like Chaos Mesh or Litmus. Verify graceful degradation and recovery.

## 6. Create Property-Based Testing for Event Correlation [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2, 21.3
### Description: Implement property-based tests validating event correlation logic handles all valid webhook payload variations and label formats
### Details:
Test properties: any valid task-* label format extracts correct ID, correlation finds unique suspended workflow, duplicate events are idempotent, malformed payloads don't crash system, label selector matching is deterministic. Use hypothesis or similar framework. Generate thousands of test cases automatically. Verify JQ expressions handle edge cases.

## 7. Build Performance Measurement Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.3, 21.4
### Description: Implement comprehensive latency measurement and bottleneck identification across all workflow stages and agent interactions
### Details:
Measure: end-to-end workflow completion time, individual stage durations (Rex, Blaze, Tess), webhook to workflow correlation latency, suspension/resume overhead, agent startup and initialization time, artifact passing between stages. Create performance baselines and regression detection. Generate flame graphs and trace analysis. Identify optimization opportunities.

## 8. Setup Continuous E2E Test Execution [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2, 21.3, 21.4, 21.5, 21.6, 21.7
### Description: Configure automated test execution pipeline running full E2E suite on schedule and PR triggers with result reporting
### Details:
Create Argo Workflow or GitHub Actions pipeline: run E2E tests every 4 hours and on PR changes, execute test scenarios in parallel where possible, collect and aggregate test results and metrics, publish results to Grafana dashboard, send alerts on test failures, maintain test history and trend analysis. Integrate with existing CI/CD pipeline.
