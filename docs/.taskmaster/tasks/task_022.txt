# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Resource Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: low
# Description: Configure resource limits, quotas, and autoscaling for agent pods and workflow components
# Details:
Set resource requests/limits for agent pods (CPU: 2-4 cores, Memory: 8-16Gi based on model). Configure PVC size limits per agent (start with 10Gi). Implement workflow-level resource quotas. Setup HPA for controller deployment. Configure pod priority classes for critical workflows. Implement resource monitoring and alerting. Consider using Kubernetes VPA for right-sizing.

# Test Strategy:
Test agents run within resource limits. Verify OOM handling and recovery. Test autoscaling under load. Validate quota enforcement. Monitor resource utilization patterns. Test priority scheduling under contention.
