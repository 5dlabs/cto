# Task ID: 25
# Title: Production Deployment Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 24
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create GitOps deployment pipeline for rolling out multi-agent workflow system to production
# Details:
Setup ArgoCD applications for all components (controller, Argo Workflows, Argo Events). Implement progressive rollout strategy with canary deployments. Create rollback procedures with version pinning. Configure production-specific parameters (timeouts, retries, resources). Implement feature flags for gradual enablement. Setup production monitoring and alerting. Use Flux or ArgoCD for GitOps automation.

# Test Strategy:
Test deployment in staging environment. Verify rollback procedures work correctly. Test canary deployment with traffic splitting. Validate monitoring in production. Test feature flag toggles. Perform load testing before production rollout.
