# Task ID: 8
# Title: Build Rex Remediation Sensor
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create dedicated Argo Events Sensor to detect Rex push events and trigger QA pipeline restart with downstream cancellation
# Details:
Create rex-remediation-restart Sensor filtering push events where sender.login='5DLabs-Rex[bot]' or configured implementation agent. Implement trigger to delete running Cleo/Tess CodeRun CRDs using labelSelector: 'task-id={{task-id}},github-app!=5DLabs-Rex'. Restart workflow from quality-work stage. Use Argo Events data filters and conditional triggers. Implement idempotency to prevent duplicate restarts. Consider using Kubernetes owner references for cascade deletion.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate Rex push events and verify Cleo/Tess work cancellation. Test labelSelector correctly excludes Rex's own work. Verify QA pipeline restarts cleanly. Test rapid sequential pushes don't cause issues.
