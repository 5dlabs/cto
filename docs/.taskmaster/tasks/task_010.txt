# Task ID: 10
# Title: Add Security Features and Error Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive security measures and robust error handling throughout the platform
# Details:
Add transaction simulation before execution to prevent failures. Implement rate limiting for RPC calls. Add input sanitization for all user inputs. Create comprehensive error boundaries in React. Implement proper key management (never expose private keys). Add CORS protection for API calls. Create audit logging for critical operations. Implement session timeout for wallet connections.

# Test Strategy:
Perform security audit of all input fields, test error boundaries with various failure scenarios, verify rate limiting works, test transaction simulation accuracy, validate key security

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Transaction Simulation System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a comprehensive transaction simulation framework that validates transactions before execution to prevent failures and protect users from costly mistakes
### Details:
Create simulation service using Solana's simulateTransaction RPC method. Build wrapper functions to parse simulation results and identify potential failures. Implement checks for: insufficient balance, account ownership, program errors, compute unit limits. Create user-friendly error messages for common failure scenarios. Add simulation caching to reduce RPC calls. Integrate with trading execution engine to run simulations before all swaps.

## 2. Add RPC Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement rate limiting for all RPC calls to prevent abuse and ensure stable performance under high load
### Details:
Create rate limiter using token bucket algorithm. Configure limits per endpoint (e.g., 100 req/min for getAccountInfo, 50 req/min for sendTransaction). Implement request queuing for rate-limited calls. Add exponential backoff for retry logic. Create monitoring for rate limit hits. Support multiple RPC endpoints with fallback logic. Add user-specific rate limits for authenticated endpoints.

## 3. Create Input Sanitization Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all user inputs to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity
### Details:
Implement validation schemas using Zod for all API endpoints. Create sanitization functions for: wallet addresses (base58 validation), token amounts (decimal precision, max values), slippage percentages (0-100 range). Add XSS protection for any text inputs. Validate all Solana public keys and program IDs. Create whitelist for allowed token mints. Implement request body size limits.

## 4. Implement React Error Boundaries [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive error handling in the React application with graceful fallbacks and error reporting
### Details:
Build top-level ErrorBoundary component with fallback UI. Create specific error boundaries for: trading interface, wallet connection, transaction history. Implement error logging to external service (Sentry/LogRocket). Add user-friendly error messages with recovery actions. Create error recovery mechanisms (retry buttons, refresh prompts). Implement error state persistence to prevent loops.

## 5. Design Secure Key Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement secure handling of sensitive data ensuring private keys are never exposed or stored insecurely
### Details:
Ensure all private key operations happen in-wallet (Phantom, Solflare). Never request or store private keys in application. Implement secure storage for non-sensitive data using encrypted IndexedDB. Create secure communication channel for wallet interactions. Add key derivation for any app-specific signing needs. Implement secure session tokens for authenticated operations. Add memory cleanup for sensitive data.

## 6. Add CORS Protection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement proper CORS configuration to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests and protect API endpoints
### Details:
Configure CORS headers for all API endpoints with strict origin whitelist. Implement preflight request handling for complex requests. Add CSRF token validation for state-changing operations. Configure secure cookie settings (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite). Implement origin validation for WebSocket connections. Add request signing for sensitive endpoints. Create development vs production CORS policies.

## 7. Create Audit Logging System [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.5
### Description: Build comprehensive audit logging for all critical operations to ensure traceability and security monitoring
### Details:
Implement structured logging for: wallet connections/disconnections, transaction attempts/completions, configuration changes, error events. Create tamper-proof log storage with timestamps and request IDs. Add log rotation and retention policies. Implement real-time alerting for suspicious activities. Create admin dashboard for log viewing. Add export functionality for compliance. Include request metadata (IP, user agent).

## 8. Implement Session Timeout for Wallets [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.5
### Description: Create automatic session management for wallet connections with configurable timeout periods
### Details:
Implement inactivity timer that disconnects wallet after 30 minutes. Add warning modal 5 minutes before timeout. Create session extension mechanism on user activity. Store session state securely in memory only. Implement proper cleanup on timeout (clear cache, reset state). Add remember me option with secure token storage. Create re-authentication flow for expired sessions.

## 9. Conduct Security Audit and Penetration Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7, 10.8
### Description: Perform comprehensive security testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities before production deployment
### Details:
Run automated security scanning tools (OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite). Perform manual penetration testing on all endpoints. Test for: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, authentication bypass, rate limit bypass. Audit smart contract interactions for reentrancy and overflow issues. Review all dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Create security checklist and remediation plan. Document security best practices for team.
