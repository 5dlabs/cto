# Task ID: 20
# Title: Setup Workflow Failure Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive error handling, retry logic, and failure recovery for all workflow stages
# Details:
Define retry strategies per workflow stage (exponential backoff). Implement failure notifications (Slack, email) for critical failures. Create failure analysis templates to identify root causes. Add manual intervention points for unrecoverable errors. Implement workflow rollback for partial completions. Use Argo Workflows retry, retryStrategy, and onExit handlers. Consider dead letter queue pattern for failed events.

# Test Strategy:
Test retry logic with transient failures. Verify notifications sent for critical errors. Test rollback scenarios. Validate manual intervention workflow. Simulate various failure modes (network, API limits, resource constraints).
