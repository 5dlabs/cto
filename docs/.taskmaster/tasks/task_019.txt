# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement PR Approval Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 18
# Priority: low
# Description: Build automated PR approval flow triggered by Tess validation completion with human review gate
# Details:
Configure Tess to use GitHub API for PR approval after 120% satisfaction. Implement Sensor for pull_request_review events where review.state='approved' and user='5DLabs-Tess[bot]'. Resume workflow at waiting-pr-approved suspension. Add human review checkpoint before merge. Implement approval criteria validation (tests passing, coverage met, no conflicts). Use GitHub branch protection rules for enforcement.

# Test Strategy:
Test Tess approval triggers workflow resume. Verify human review gate functions correctly. Test approval with various PR states. Validate branch protection enforcement. Test approval revocation scenarios.
