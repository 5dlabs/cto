			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 7 subtasks covering: 1) Workspace and crate skeleton (crates/watcher, bot, input-bridge, shared) with Cargo.toml workspace-level profiles (opt-level z, LTO, codegen-units=1 where applicable). 2) Dependencies and crate features wired (tokio, serde, reqwest, serenity, axum, tower, thiserror, tracing, anyhow, clap, notify, similar, time, governor optional, parking_lot, bytes; feature flags per crate as specified). 3) Dev tooling: rustfmt, clippy, editorconfig, dotenvy for dev only, RUSTFLAGS/target configs and size optimizations for watcher. 4) CI workflows (GitHub Actions) for fmt-check, clippy -D warnings, cargo test --all, build --release; cache setup. 5) Tracing/log setup (tracing-subscriber JSON optional), RUST_LOG guidance, example env files. 6) README with quickstart, workspace commands, run targets; CONTRIBUTING notes. 7) Baseline build and size check scripts (hello-world watcher run with /usr/bin/time) and makefile/scripts to orchestrate common tasks. Define DoD: all crates compile, CI green, README present, baseline sizes captured.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate breadth across tooling, CI, and multi-crate setup but low algorithmic complexity; primary risk is wiring features and profiles correctly across crates."

			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 8 subtasks: 1) Path resolution and discovery (env WORKSPACE_PATH, default location scan, retry with backoff). 2) Async tailer core using tokio with BufReader, buffer reuse, ≤100ms latency target. 3) Filesystem notifications via notify with fallback timed polling and missed-event recovery. 4) Rotation/creation handling (reopen on rename/truncate, late file creation). 5) Shared event model types and serde mappings; defensive parsing that ignores unknowns. 6) Configurable filters (includeTools, includePatterns, minStdoutLength) and parity-mode semantics. 7) Performance profiling hooks and optimizations (allocation avoidance, capacities). 8) Testing: unit parsing, integration tailer with temp file appends, rotation test, and fuzzing junk lines to avoid panics. DoD: sustained tail latency avg <100ms in integration test; all tests pass.",
			"reasoning": "Concurrency, file system edge cases, and robustness under rotation raise complexity; performance constraints and defensive parsing add non-trivial work."

			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 9 subtasks: 1) Embed builders per event template with Discord limits enforced (fields, colors, content lengths). 2) Truncation helpers (trim_with_note) and content sanitization (code-fence escaping, zero-width space strategy). 3) Allowed mentions disabled in payload builder. 4) Diffing utilities: parse or compute diffs (similar::TextDiff), contextual hunk extraction (40–60 lines), formatting as ```diff. 5) Attachments pipeline for overflow content with attachment:// linking and size summaries. 6) Batching struct and logic: Batch and Batch::try_push, time/window-based flush policy. 7) Cost estimator mapping from model→rates with configuration and safe fallbacks. 8) Snapshot and boundary tests (insta) including field counts, truncation markers, fence closure, attachments. 9) Security tests (mention neutralization, ANSI stripping). DoD: snapshots stable, boundary tests green, and builder rejects payloads exceeding limits.",
			"reasoning": "Multiple edge cases with Discord limits, diff formatting, and safe truncation; requires careful design and extensive tests to prevent message rejections."

			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 7 subtasks: 1) Reqwest client factory (pooling, gzip, timeouts). 2) Payload builder for embeds + multipart attachments referencing attachment:// and pre-send validation of limits. 3) Queue + worker implementing batching (≤10 embeds) and 250ms flush window. 4) 429 handling: parse Retry-After/X-RateLimit-Reset-After, jittered sleeps, requeue. 5) Transient 5xx retry with capped exponential backoff; 4xx handling with logging and drop. 6) Telemetry (success/failure logs, retry counters, latency histograms). 7) Wiremock test suite for 200/429/5xx, coalescing concurrency, and attachment correctness. DoD: tests cover rate-limit/backoff paths; worker achieves near-real-time flush without exceeding limits.",
			"reasoning": "Network error handling, rate-limit semantics, and multipart uploads add complexity; correctness depends on precise adherence to Discord’s behavior."

DoD: e2e test green with header and final summary; resource use within targets in synthetic run.",
			"reasoning": "Cross-component orchestration with lifecycle events and resilience concerns; requires careful shutdown/finalization and health signaling."

DoD: endpoints functional, channels/webhooks created and cleaned per retention, and no token leakage to clients.",
			"reasoning": "Bot/channel lifecycle and an HTTP interface need coordinated Discord API use and state management; retention and permissions add operational complexity."

DoD: messages sent in run channel reach FIFO, out-of-channel ignored, rate limits enforced.",
			"reasoning": "Bridges two processes with simple policies; main risks are correct scoping, local security, and reliable FIFO I/O behavior."

DoD: tests demonstrate blocked cross-run injection, mention suppression, revoked webhooks, and no secret leakage in logs.",
			"reasoning": "Cross-cutting controls that must be consistent across components; correctness depends on policy enforcement and secure defaults."

DoD: helm template produces valid manifests; kind install passes health checks; secrets scoped correctly.",

DoD: docs peer-reviewed; acceptance and performance criteria satisfied with recorded evidence.",
