# Title: Create Workflow Monitoring Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop Grafana dashboard to monitor multi-agent workflow progress, agent performance, and system health
# Details:
Create Grafana dashboard using existing telemetry stack (Victoria Metrics). Track metrics: workflow duration by stage, agent success rates, suspension wait times, task completion rates. Use PromQL queries against Argo Workflows metrics. Add alerts for stuck workflows (>24h at same stage). Visualize agent-specific performance (Rex vs Blaze comparison). Include GitHub webhook processing metrics. Reference existing infra/telemetry/telemetry-dashboards/.

# Test Strategy:
Verify metrics collected from all workflow stages. Test dashboard updates in real-time. Validate alerts trigger correctly. Load test with multiple concurrent workflows. Check dashboard performance with historical data.
