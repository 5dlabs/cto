# Task ID: 11
# Title: Setup Tess Kubernetes RBAC
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Configure comprehensive RBAC permissions for Tess agent to perform live Kubernetes testing and deployments
# Details:
Create ServiceAccount 'coderun-tess' in agent-platform namespace. Define ClusterRole with extensive permissions for testing (initially cluster-admin for lab, refine later). Create ClusterRoleBinding linking ServiceAccount to ClusterRole. Configure controller to use agent-specific ServiceAccounts based on github_app. Update CodeRun CRD spec to reference serviceAccountName. Consider using Kubernetes RBAC aggregation for maintainability.

# Test Strategy:
Test Tess can create/read/update/delete test resources. Verify other agents don't have excessive permissions. Validate ServiceAccount token mounting in pods. Test permission boundaries with various K8s operations.
