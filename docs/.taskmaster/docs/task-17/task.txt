# Task ID: 17
# Title: Setup Multi-Task Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 14
# Priority: low
# Description: Extend workflow to handle multiple tasks in sequence with proper state management and progress tracking
# Details:
Implement workflow parameter for task list or task range. Create loop template to iterate through tasks. Maintain workflow state between tasks using Argo parameters. Implement checkpointing for long-running multi-task workflows. Add task progress reporting to workflow status. Consider using Argo Workflows memoization for completed steps. Handle partial failures with retry policies.

# Test Strategy:
Test workflow with multiple sequential tasks. Verify state maintained between tasks. Test failure recovery mid-sequence. Validate checkpoint restoration. Monitor resource usage over extended runs.
