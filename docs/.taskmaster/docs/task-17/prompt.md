# Task 17: Multi-Task Processing - Autonomous Implementation Prompt



## Objective
Implement a comprehensive multi-task processing system that can execute sequences of tasks with proper state management, progress tracking, checkpointing, and failure recovery. Enable workflows to handle multiple related tasks while maintaining resilience and observability.

## Context
You are extending the Task Master orchestration system to support complex workflows spanning multiple tasks. This requires robust state management, progress monitoring, and checkpoint/recovery mechanisms to handle long-running sequences reliably.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Workflow Definition and Execution
Create Argo Workflow templates that support:
- **Task List Processing**: Accept JSON arrays of task IDs
- **Task Range Processing**: Support range specifications like "1-5" or "10,12,14"
- **Sequential Execution**: Process tasks in proper dependency order
- **Parallel Capabilities**: Execute independent tasks concurrently where possible

### 2. State Management Implementation
**Location**: `controller/src/workflow/state.rs`

Implement comprehensive state tracking:



```rust
pub struct WorkflowState {
    pub workflow_id: Uuid,
    pub start_time: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub total_tasks: usize,
    pub completed_tasks: usize,
    pub failed_tasks: usize,
    pub current_task_index: usize,
    pub task_results: HashMap<String, TaskResult>,
    pub checkpoints: Vec<Checkpoint>,
    pub status: WorkflowStatus,
}






```

Key methods to implement:


- `update_task_result()` - Record individual task completion


- `create_checkpoint()` - Save intermediate state


- `get_progress()` - Calculate completion percentage


- `is_task_completed()` - Check if task was already processed (memoization)

### 3. Progress Tracking System
**Location**: `controller/src/workflow/progress.rs`

Create real-time progress monitoring:


- Track current task execution


- Calculate progress percentages


- Estimate completion times


- Provide detailed task breakdown


- Support multiple concurrent workflows

### 4. Argo Workflow Integration
**Location**: `workflows/multi-task-processing.yaml`

Design workflow templates with:
- **Parameter Handling**: Accept task lists and configuration
- **Loop Processing**: Iterate through task sequences
- **State Persistence**: Maintain state between executions
- **Memoization**: Avoid re-executing completed tasks
- **Error Handling**: Implement retry and continue-on-error policies

### 5. Checkpoint and Recovery
Implement robust checkpointing:
- **Configurable Intervals**: Save state after N tasks
- **State Snapshots**: Capture complete workflow state
- **Recovery Logic**: Resume from last successful checkpoint
- **Storage Integration**: Use Redis/database for persistence

## Technical Implementation Details



### Workflow Template Structure



```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: WorkflowTemplate
metadata:
  name: multi-task-processor
spec:
  entrypoint: process-task-sequence
  arguments:
    parameters:
    - name: task-list          # JSON array of task IDs
    - name: task-range         # Range specification
    - name: continue-on-error  # Error handling policy
    - name: checkpoint-interval # Checkpoint frequency






```

### State Storage Interface



```rust
#[async_trait::async_trait]
pub trait StateStorage: Send + Sync {
    async fn save_state(&self, state: &WorkflowState) -> Result<(), StateError>;
    async fn load_state(&self, workflow_id: &Uuid) -> Result<Option<WorkflowState>, StateError>;
    async fn delete_state(&self, workflow_id: &Uuid) -> Result<(), StateError>;
}






```

### Progress Reporting API



```rust
pub async fn get_workflow_progress(workflow_id: &Uuid) -> Result<ProgressReport, Error> {
    // Return real-time progress information
}

pub async fn list_active_workflows() -> Result<Vec<ProgressReport>, Error> {
    // Return all currently running workflows
}






```

## Integration Points

### 1. Task Execution Service


- Integrate with existing task controller


- Support batch task processing


- Handle task dependencies and sequencing


- Implement proper error propagation

### 2. Monitoring and Metrics


- Export Prometheus metrics for workflow progress


- Track task execution times and success rates


- Monitor resource utilization


- Alert on workflow failures or delays

### 3. API Endpoints



```rust
// REST API for workflow management
POST /api/workflows/multi-task
GET  /api/workflows/{id}/progress
GET  /api/workflows/{id}/state
PUT  /api/workflows/{id}/checkpoint
POST /api/workflows/{id}/resume






```

## Error Handling Requirements



### 1. Task-Level Failures


- Individual task retry with exponential backoff


- Continue-on-error policy support


- Failure reason capture and reporting


- Partial workflow completion handling



### 2. Workflow-Level Failures


- Checkpoint-based recovery


- State persistence on unexpected termination


- Resource cleanup on failure


- Notification and alerting integration



### 3. System-Level Failures


- Kubernetes node failures


- Network partition handling


- Storage system outages


- Service restart recovery

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests


- State management operations


- Progress calculation logic


- Checkpoint creation and restoration


- Task sequencing algorithms
