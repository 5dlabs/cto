# Acceptance Criteria: Workflow Stage Transitions

Note: Scope limited to enhancing the existing implementation. Baseline stage labeling at suspend points and event correlation sensors already exist. Focus on adding explicit post-agent stage transitions and atomic label update mechanisms without reworking correlation sensors.

## Core Stage Management Requirements

### ✅ Stage Transition System
- [ ] **Stage Update Template**: `update-workflow-stage` template implemented for atomic label updates
- [ ] **Stage Progression Flow**: Correct transitions: `waiting-pr-created` → `waiting-ready-for-qa` → `waiting-pr-approved`
- [ ] **Atomic Operations**: All label updates use JSON merge patch for atomicity
- [ ] **Idempotent Updates**: Stage updates safe to retry and duplicate without side effects
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Failed stage transitions cause workflow failure with clear error messages

### ✅ Workflow Label Management
- [ ] **Current Stage Label**: `current-stage` label accurately reflects workflow progress
- [ ] **Task Correlation Label**: `task-id` label enables event correlation
- [ ] **Repository Context**: `repository` label supports multi-repo scenarios
- [ ] **Timestamp Tracking**: `updated-at` label tracks when stage transitions occur
- [ ] **Label Consistency**: All required labels present and correctly formatted

## Workflow Integration Requirements

### ✅ Agent Stage Coordination
- [ ] **Rex Completion**: Rex completion triggers update to `waiting-pr-created`
- [ ] **Cleo Completion**: Cleo completion triggers update to `waiting-ready-for-qa`
- [ ] **Tess Completion**: Tess completion triggers update to `waiting-pr-approved`
