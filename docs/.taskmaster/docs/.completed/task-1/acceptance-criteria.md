## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: CRD Processing Flow
**Objective**: Validate understanding of CRD â†’ Pod flow

**Steps**:


1. Submit a test CodeRun CRD


2. Monitor controller logs


3. Track resource creation (PVC, ConfigMap, Pod)


4. Verify status updates

**Expected Result**: Complete trace of reconciliation flow documented

### Test Case 2: Template Rendering
**Objective**: Verify template system capabilities

**Steps**:


1. Create test CRD with specific `github_app` value


2. Observe generated ConfigMap contents


3. Verify variable substitution


4. Test conditional logic rendering

**Expected Result**: Template customization points identified

### Test Case 3: Session Continuity
**Objective**: Understand `continue_session` behavior

**Steps**:
1. Submit CRD with `continue_session: true`


2. Observe PVC handling


3. Verify workspace persistence


4. Test session restoration

**Expected Result**: Session continuity mechanism documented

### Test Case 4: Webhook Correlation
**Objective**: Validate event processing understanding

**Steps**:


1. Trigger GitHub webhook


2. Monitor Argo Events processing


3. Verify payload extraction


4. Test correlation logic

**Expected Result**: Event correlation mechanism mapped

### Test Case 5: Multi-Agent Differentiation
**Objective**: Confirm agent-specific capabilities

**Steps**:


1. Submit CRDs with different `github_app` values


2. Compare generated resources


3. Verify secret mounting differences


4. Test environment variable injection

**Expected Result**: Agent differentiation mechanisms documented

## Notes



- This is a discovery and documentation task - no implementation required


- Focus on understanding existing patterns before proposing changes


- Consider the needs of Rex, Cleo, and Tess agents in analysis


- Document rate limiting and operational considerations


- Include security implications of multi-agent support
