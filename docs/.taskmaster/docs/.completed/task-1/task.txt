# Task ID: 1
# Title: Analyze Existing CodeRun Controller Architecture
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform comprehensive discovery and documentation of the existing CodeRun controller implementation, CRD structure, template system, and agent pod creation flow - COMPLETED with 47-page technical analysis
# Details:
DISCOVERY PHASE COMPLETE: Comprehensive analysis documented in task-1-discovery-report.md (47 pages). Key findings: 1) CRD fully supports multi-agent scenarios with github_app field and agent-specific env/secrets 2) Controller has solid reconciliation patterns with status-first idempotency and TTL safety 3) Handlebars template system ready for agent-specific customization with conditional logic support 4) Argo Events infrastructure working (rate-limited but functional) 5) GitHub App authentication flow production-ready in container.sh.hbs (1120+ lines). Infrastructure confirmed ready for multi-agent implementation with clear modification priorities identified.

# Test Strategy:
Documentation validated through actual CodeRun submissions and controller log analysis. Test CRDs confirmed the documented flow matches observed behavior. kubectl describe and controller logs verified understanding of reconciliation patterns, finalizer logic, and status updates. All compatibility requirements for existing Rex/Blaze workflows documented.
