# Acceptance Criteria: Implementation DAG WorkflowTemplate

## DAG Structure and Dependencies
- [ ] Five-stage pipeline: set-params → implement → clippy-format → qa-testing → deploy → acceptance
- [ ] Sequential dependencies prevent premature execution
- [ ] Failure at any stage prevents downstream execution
- [ ] Parameter passing between stages maintains consistency

## Agent Integration
- [ ] Rex agent implements functionality from task specifications
- [ ] Clippy agent applies formatting and linting
- [ ] QA agent generates comprehensive test suites
- [ ] All agents use coderun-template integration pattern

## Deployment Management
- [ ] Per-PR namespace creation with proper labeling
- [ ] Helm deployment with configurable parameters
- [ ] Service URL extraction and validation
- [ ] Preview environment accessibility

## Acceptance Testing
- [ ] HTTP endpoint testing with performance metrics
- [ ] Configurable success rate and latency thresholds
- [ ] Comprehensive artifact collection
- [ ] Failure when thresholds not met

## Resource Management
- [ ] Automatic cleanup on workflow failure
- [ ] TTL-based cleanup for successful deployments
- [ ] Resource quotas and RBAC enforcement
- [ ] Proper namespace isolation

## QA Approval Process
- [ ] GitHub PR approval on successful completion
- [ ] No auto-merge functionality implemented
- [ ] Evidence linking in PR comments
- [ ] Manual review facilitation through artifacts

## Security and Performance
- [ ] RBAC compliance with minimal permissions
- [ ] Container security best practices
- [ ] Resource usage within defined limits
- [ ] Execution time under 30 minutes total
