### ✅ Pod Security and Configuration
- [ ] Init container validates all connections before main container starts
- [ ] PostgreSQL connection test succeeds: `psql -c "SELECT version();"`
- [ ] Redis connection test succeeds: `redis-cli ping`
- [ ] Argo CD authentication test succeeds: `argocd cluster list`
- [ ] Pod fails to start if any connection validation fails
- [ ] Security context configured with appropriate user and capabilities

### ✅ Volume and Secret Mounts
- [ ] TLS certificates mounted at `/etc/ssl/certs/custom`
- [ ] Configuration files mounted from ConfigMap at `/etc/tess-config`

- [ ] Secret permissions restrict access to Tess pod only
- [ ] Volume mounts use read-only where appropriate

## Security Implementation

### ✅ TLS Certificate Management
- [ ] Client certificates generated for database connections
- [ ] Certificates have appropriate usage flags: client auth, digital signature
