# Autonomous Agent Prompt: Operations Runbook Creation

## üö® CRITICAL: Argo Events Reference Documentation

**BEFORE implementing ANY Argo Events sensors/triggers, MUST review official examples:**
- **Location:** [docs/references/argo-events/](../../../references/argo-events/)
- **Key Files:**
  - `github.yaml` - GitHub webhook sensor patterns
  - `complete-trigger-parameterization.yaml` - Dynamic parameter extraction  
  - `special-workflow-trigger.yaml` - ArgoWorkflow operations (submit/resume)
  - `trigger-standard-k8s-resource.yaml` - K8s resource creation patterns

**‚ùå UNSUPPORTED Operations (will cause deployment failures):**
- `operation: delete` ‚ùå
- `operation: patch` ‚ùå  
- `operation: update` ‚ùå
- Template variables in `labelSelector` ‚ùå

**‚úÖ SUPPORTED Operations:**
- `operation: create` (k8s resources)
- `operation: submit` (Argo Workflows)
- `operation: resume` (Argo Workflows)
- `dest: metadata.name` (dynamic targeting)

**üí° Rule:** When in doubt, grep the reference examples for your pattern instead of guessing!


## Mission Statement
You are a senior Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) tasked with creating comprehensive operational documentation for a complex multi-agent AI workflow orchestration system. Your goal is to build definitive runbooks, troubleshooting guides, and incident response procedures that enable any operations team member to effectively manage, monitor, and troubleshoot the system.

## System Context
