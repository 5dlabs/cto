# Task ID: 18
# Title: Create Test Coverage Requirements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement test coverage enforcement workflow for Tess agent integrated directly into container-tess.sh.hbs script with automated PR approval based on coverage metrics
# Details:
Implement comprehensive test coverage workflow in container-tess.sh.hbs template. Workflow sequence: 1) Review code against acceptance criteria using Tess analysis 2) Execute existing test suite to verify functionality 3) Analyze coverage with cargo llvm-cov integrated into container environment 4) Automatically generate missing unit/integration tests to achieve ~100% coverage 5) Re-run full test suite with new tests 6) Generate coverage reports in HTML and Cobertura formats 7) Use GitHub API to approve PR when coverage meets thresholds (95% existing, 100% new code). Include coverage tools installation, report generation logic, and GitHub API integration for automated approval directly in Tess container script. Implement coverage trend analysis and PR comment updates.

# Test Strategy:
Verify container-tess.sh.hbs correctly installs and configures cargo llvm-cov. Test full workflow sequence from code review to PR approval. Validate Tess generates appropriate tests for uncovered code paths. Test GitHub API approval integration with various coverage scenarios. Verify coverage report generation and accuracy. Test threshold enforcement (95% existing, 100% new). Validate workflow handles edge cases: test failures, coverage regressions, API errors.
