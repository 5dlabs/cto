### 4. Chaos Testing Scenarios ✅
**Requirement**: Comprehensive failure testing with automated recovery validation

**Acceptance Tests**:
- [ ] **Infrastructure Failures**
  - Random pod termination during agent execution (recovery < 5 minutes)
  - Network partitions between components (automatic retry and recovery)

  - Persistent volume failures with data recovery

- [ ] **External Service Failures**
  - GitHub API unavailability (retry with exponential backoff)
  - GitHub webhook delivery failures (retry mechanism verification)
  - MCP documentation server failures (fallback behavior)
  - Database connectivity issues (connection pooling and retry)

- [ ] **Component-Specific Failures**
  - Argo Workflows controller restart (workflow state preservation)
  - Argo Events sensor failures (event replay capability)
  - Agent container crashes mid-execution (session resumption)
  - Multiple concurrent failures (system stability under stress)

**Verification Method**: Execute chaos scenarios in isolated test environment, measure recovery times, and verify system returns to fully functional state within SLA requirements.

### 5. Performance Measurement Suite ✅
**Requirement**: Comprehensive latency tracking and bottleneck identification

**Acceptance Tests**:
- [ ] **End-to-End Timing**
  - Measures complete workflow duration from trigger to completion
  - Tracks individual stage durations with 1-second precision
  - Identifies longest-running stages and operations
  - Generates performance reports with historical trending

- [ ] **Component-Level Metrics**
  - Webhook processing latency (< 5 seconds target)
  - Workflow correlation time (< 30 seconds target)
  - Agent startup and initialization (< 60 seconds target)
  - Suspension/resume overhead (< 10 seconds target)

- [ ] **Resource Utilization Tracking**
  - CPU and memory usage per agent during execution
  - Persistent volume I/O patterns and performance
  - Network usage and external API call patterns
  - Resource efficiency comparison across different task complexities

**Verification Method**: Execute performance test suite with 50 workflows of varying complexity, generate performance baseline, and verify all metrics fall within acceptable ranges with no significant outliers.

### 6. Property-Based Testing ✅
**Requirement**: Automated validation of event correlation logic edge cases

**Acceptance Tests**:
- [ ] **Task ID Extraction Validation**
  - Tests all valid task label formats (task-1 through task-999)
  - Validates branch name parsing handles all documented patterns
  - Confirms malformed labels/branches don't cause false matches
  - Verifies extraction works with additional labels present

- [ ] **Event Correlation Properties**
  - Any valid webhook payload correlates to exactly one workflow
  - Duplicate events are properly deduplicated
  - Out-of-order events don't cause incorrect state transitions
  - Invalid events are rejected with proper error reporting

- [ ] **JQ Expression Validation**
  - All webhook processing JQ expressions handle malformed JSON gracefully
  - Edge cases like empty arrays, null values, missing fields are handled
  - Unicode characters and special symbols in labels don't break parsing
