# Label System Harmonization - Complete

## Date: 2025-01-XX

## Executive Summary

Successfully harmonized the multi-agent label system across all workflows, sensors, and agent scripts. The system now uses **GitHub native PR reviews** instead of custom status labels for stage transitions.

## Final Agent Order: Rex → Cleo → Tess

### Rationale

1. **Rex (Implementation)**: Writes the code, creates PR with correlation labels
2. **Cleo (Code Quality)**: Reviews code quality (linting, formatting, unit tests)
3. **Tess (QA/Testing)**: End-to-end testing in live Kubernetes environment

**Why this order is correct:**
- Code must exist before quality checks
- Quality checks should pass before expensive E2E testing
- E2E testing validates acceptance criteria as final gate

## Label System (Final State)

### Correlation Labels (Rex adds during PR creation)
- `task-{id}` - Task tracking
- `service-{name}` - Service tracking
- `run-{workflow}` - Workflow run tracking

### Status Labels - REMOVED ❌
All status labels removed in favor of GitHub PR reviews:
- ~~`needs-fixes`~~ → Use GitHub `REQUEST_CHANGES` review
- ~~`needs-cleo`~~ → Workflow stage tracking
- ~~`needs-tess`~~ → Workflow stage tracking
- ~~`approved`~~ → Use GitHub `APPROVE` review count
- ~~`fixing-in-progress`~~ → Not used
- ~~`failed-remediation`~~ → Workflow failure state
- ~~`ready-for-qa`~~ → Not needed

## Workflow Stages (Final)

```
pending → waiting-pr-created → waiting-quality-complete → waiting-ready-for-qa → waiting-pr-merged → completed
```

**Stage Transitions:**
1. `pending` → `waiting-pr-created` (Rex creates PR)
2. `waiting-pr-created` → `waiting-quality-complete` (Cleo approves via PR review)
3. `waiting-quality-complete` → `waiting-ready-for-qa` (Tess approves via PR review)
4. `waiting-ready-for-qa` → `waiting-pr-merged` (Human merges PR)
5. `waiting-pr-merged` → `completed` (Workflow completes)

## Changes Made

### 1. Workflow Template (`play-workflow-template.yaml`)
- ✅ Reordered steps: Rex → Cleo → Tess
- ✅ Updated stage transitions to use `waiting-quality-complete`
- ✅ Updated comments to reflect correct agent order

### 2. Sensors (`stage-aware-resume-sensor.yaml`)
- ✅ Added `cleo-approved-event` dependency (filters for `5dlabs-cleo[bot]`)
- ✅ Added `tess-approved-event` dependency (filters for `5dlabs-tess[bot]`)
- ✅ Removed `ready-for-qa-event` label-based trigger
- ✅ Created `resume-after-cleo-approval` trigger (resumes at `waiting-quality-complete`)
- ✅ Created `resume-after-tess-approval` trigger (resumes at `waiting-ready-for-qa`)

### 3. Claude Agent Scripts

#### Tess (`container-tess.sh.hbs`)
- ✅ Already uses `gh pr review --approve` and `--request-changes`
- ✅ Removed all label manipulation (`pr_add_labels`/`pr_remove_labels`)
- ✅ Keeps GitHub PR review posting

#### Cleo (`container-cleo.sh.hbs`)
- ✅ Added `gh pr review --approve` for quality approval
- ✅ Added `gh pr review --request-changes` for quality issues
- ✅ Removed all label manipulation
- ✅ Simplified status updates

### 4. Documentation (`CLAUDE.md`)
- ✅ Updated agent order to Rex → Cleo → Tess
- ✅ Added rationale for agent ordering
- ✅ Updated quality gates description
- ✅ Documented agent responsibilities

## Benefits

1. **Simpler**: 3 correlation labels instead of 9 labels total
2. **Native**: Uses GitHub's built-in PR review system
3. **Visible**: PR approval state clear in GitHub UI
4. **Less coordination**: No label synchronization needed
5. **Fewer sensors**: One review webhook instead of multiple label webhooks

## Testing Status

- [ ] Test Rex → Cleo flow (PR creation → Cleo approval)
- [ ] Test Cleo → Tess flow (Cleo approval → Tess activation)
- [ ] Test Tess → Complete flow (Tess approval → workflow completion)
- [ ] Verify sensor event correlation works correctly
- [ ] Verify stage transitions are atomic

## Codex/Cursor/Factory Status

**No changes needed** - These CLIs already have the correct correlation label logic and don't use status labels.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy updated workflow template and sensors to cluster
2. Test complete Rex → Cleo → Tess flow
3. Monitor sensor logs for proper webhook correlation
4. Validate stage transitions work correctly
5. Remove unused status label definitions from codebase (cleanup task)
