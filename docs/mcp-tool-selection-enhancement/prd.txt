# MCP Tool Selection Enhancement PRD

## Overview

This mini-project transforms the MCP tool selection system from dynamic, task-based tool generation to static, Helm-defined tool configurations for each agent. This approach reduces complexity, improves performance, and provides better control over agent capabilities through declarative configuration.

## Core Features

### 1. Static Tool Configuration
**Requirements:**
- Define agent-specific tool sets in Helm configuration
- Move from dynamic tool generation to static tool assignment
- Support for role-based tool profiles (Rex: development, Cleo: quality, Tess: testing)
- Eliminate tool-man configuration copying for each task
- Reduce token usage by 70% for tool configuration

**Success Criteria:**
- Each agent has predefined tools based on their role
- No dynamic tool configuration generation per task
- Tool configuration loaded once at agent startup
- Configurable tool sets via Helm values

### 2. Helm-Based Tool Management
**Requirements:**
- Define tool configurations in Helm charts
- Support for tool inheritance and composition
- Environment-specific tool configurations
- Tool version management and updates
- Validation of tool configurations at deployment time

**Success Criteria:**
- Tool configurations defined in `values.yaml`
- Support for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Tool validation during Helm deployment
- Easy tool addition/removal via Helm upgrades

### 3. ConfigMap-Based Tool Storage
**Requirements:**
- Store agent tool configurations in Kubernetes ConfigMaps
- Eliminate expensive tool-man configuration copying
- Static tool definitions that don't change during runtime
- Support for tool metadata and descriptions
- Tool capability documentation

**Success Criteria:**
- Each agent has dedicated ConfigMap for tools
- No runtime tool configuration copying
- Tool definitions include metadata and capabilities
- ConfigMaps are versioned and managed

### 4. Agent Tool Profiles
**Requirements:**
- Predefined tool profiles for each agent type:
  - **Rex (Implementation)**: Development tools, code generation, file operations
  - **Cleo (Quality)**: Code review, testing, validation tools
  - **Tess (QA)**: Testing, verification, reporting tools
- Support for custom tool profiles
- Tool capability inheritance for common patterns
- Role-based tool access control

**Success Criteria:**
- Clear tool profiles for each agent role
- Customizable tool sets per agent instance
- Tool inheritance working correctly
- Role-based access properly enforced

### 5. Documentation Job Optimization
**Requirements:**
- Remove tool-man dependency from documentation jobs
- Simplify documentation generation process
- Use static tool definitions for documentation
- Reduce documentation job complexity and cost

**Success Criteria:**
- Documentation jobs don't use tool-man
- Documentation generation is simplified
- Static tool definitions used for docs
- Reduced resource usage for documentation

## User Experience

### Configuration Flow
```
Helm Values → ConfigMap → Agent Startup → Tool Loading → Runtime Execution
```

### Integration Points

- Version history for tool configurations

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Static Tool Configuration (Days 1-2)

### Phase 2: Helm Integration (Days 3-4)
- Integrate tool configuration into Helm charts
- Add tool validation during deployment
- Support environment-specific configurations
- Test tool inheritance and composition

### Phase 3: Documentation Optimization (Days 5-6)
- Remove tool-man dependency from docs jobs
- Implement static tool documentation

- Test documentation accuracy and completeness

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation (Days 7-8)
- End-to-end testing of tool configurations
- Performance testing and optimization
- Validation of all agent tool sets
- Documentation and deployment guides

## Risks and Mitigations

### Configuration Complexity Risk
- **Risk**: Helm configuration becomes too complex
- **Mitigation**: Use clear naming conventions and documentation

### Tool Flexibility Risk
- **Risk**: Static configuration reduces tool flexibility
- **Mitigation**: Support for custom tool profiles and inheritance

### Migration Risk
- **Risk**: Breaking changes during migration
- **Mitigation**: Implement staged migration with backward compatibility

### Performance Risk
- **Risk**: Tool loading performance issues
- **Mitigation**: Optimize ConfigMap loading and caching

## MVP Definition

- Static tool configurations for Rex, Cleo, and Tess
- Helm-based tool management
- ConfigMap storage for tool definitions
- Documentation job optimization

### Success Metrics
- 70% reduction in tool configuration token usage
- 50% faster agent startup times

  namespace: agent-platform
data:
  tools.yaml: |
    tools:
      - name: code_generation
        description: "Generate code based on requirements"
        capabilities: ["file_creation", "code_writing", "refactoring"]
        config:
          max_file_size: "1MB"
          allowed_languages: ["python", "javascript", "rust"]
      - name: file_operations
        description: "Create, modify, and delete files"
        capabilities: ["read", "write", "delete"]
        config:
          allowed_paths: ["src/", "tests/", "docs/"]
```

This approach provides a clean, maintainable, and performant solution for MCP tool management while reducing complexity and improving system reliability.
