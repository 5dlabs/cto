# Parallel Task Execution Design Discussion

## Context
We need a way to identify and safely execute tasks that don't have dependencies on each other to speed up development time. The current system executes tasks sequentially one-at-a-time.

## Core Requirements


1. **Identify tasks that can run in parallel** - Accurate dependency detection


2. **Update orchestration to handle parallel execution** - Workflow changes needed

## Key Challenge
The big risk is going too far ahead and doing work that might conflict with previous tasks. Even without direct dependencies, there could be:


- Design decisions that affect later tasks


- Architectural patterns that should be consistent


- Hidden dependencies not obvious from task descriptions

## Challenges for Parallel Task Execution

### 1. Dependency Analysis Complexity
- **Code dependencies**: Task B might modify files that Task A creates
- **Design dependencies**: Task B's approach might change based on Task A's implementation
- **Semantic dependencies**: Even if files don't overlap, the architectural decisions matter
- **Hidden dependencies**: Database schemas, API contracts, shared utilities

### 2. Conflict Types to Consider
- **File conflicts**: Same files modified by multiple tasks
- **Merge conflicts**: Adjacent code changes causing git conflicts
- **Logical conflicts**: Incompatible designs or approaches
- **Resource conflicts**: Database migrations, ports, service names
- **Architectural conflicts**: Different patterns/approaches in parallel work

## Proposed Solution Approaches

### Approach 1: Explicit Dependency Declaration
Add metadata to tasks explicitly declaring dependencies and conflict zones:




```yaml
task-5:
  depends_on: [task-1, task-3]  # Explicit dependencies
  blocks: []                     # Can run parallel with others
  conflict_zones:


    - src/api/*                  # Files this task will modify


    - database/migrations/*








```

### Approach 2: Automatic Dependency Detection
Analyze task acceptance criteria programmatically to detect:


1. File overlap analysis


2. API endpoint conflicts


3. Database table dependencies


4. Import/export relationships


5. Test coverage overlap

### Approach 3: Safe Parallelization Rules
Define categories of tasks that are safe or unsafe to parallelize:

**Safe to Parallelize:**


- Different bounded contexts (e.g., auth vs billing)


- Different layers (frontend vs backend)


- Independent features with no shared code


- Documentation tasks


- Test writing tasks (usually safe)

**Never Parallelize:**


- Database schema changes


- Core architecture changes


- API contract modifications


- Security/auth changes

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Conservative Parallel Groups
Start with explicit grouping of tasks:




```yaml
execution_groups:
  - sequential: [task-1, task-2]       # Must be sequential
  - parallel: [task-3, task-4, task-5]  # Can run together
  - sequential: [task-6]                # Depends on parallel group








```

### Phase 2: Smart Conflict Detection
Build analysis tools to detect conflicts before execution:


1. Parse acceptance criteria


2. Extract file patterns mentioned


3. Detect API endpoints


4. Identify database operations


5. Build dependency graph


6. Suggest parallelization opportunities

### Phase 3: Orchestration Updates
Modify Argo Workflows to handle parallel execution:




```yaml
- name: parallel-task-group
  parallel:
    - name: start-task-3
      template: run-rex
      arguments:
        task-id: 3
    - name: start-task-4
      template: run-rex
      arguments:
        task-id: 4

- name: wait-for-group
  dependencies: [parallel-task-group]
  template: consolidate-results








```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Speculative Execution with Rollback


- Run tasks in parallel on separate branches


- If conflicts detected, serialize and retry


- Merge successful parallel work

### 2. Conflict Prediction Score
Calculate risk score based on multiple factors:
- File overlap weight: 0.4
- API overlap weight: 0.3
- Database overlap weight: 0.5
- Semantic similarity weight: 0.2


- Only parallelize if total risk < 0.3

### 3. Progressive Parallelization


- Start with known-safe parallel patterns


- Learn from conflict history


- Gradually increase parallelization scope

## Practical Starting Point

### 1. Tag Tasks with Parallelization Hints




```yaml
task-3:
  parallel_safe: true
  modifies: ["src/auth/*"]
  depends_on_completion: [task-1]
  can_run_with: [task-4, task-5]








```



### 2. Create Parallel Workflow Template


- Detect tasks with `can_run_with` metadata


- Launch parallel CodeRuns


- Monitor for conflicts


- Consolidate at merge points



### 3. Start with Obvious Cases
Begin parallelization with low-risk scenarios:


- Documentation tasks


- Test writing tasks


- Independent microservices


- Frontend/backend splits

## Key Insight
Start conservative and gradually expand parallelization as we learn which patterns are truly safe. Track conflict history to improve predictions over time.



## Next Steps


1. Define task metadata schema for dependencies


2. Build conflict detection prototype


3. Create parallel workflow templates


4. Test with low-risk task pairs


5. Iterate based on results
