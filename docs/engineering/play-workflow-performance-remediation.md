# Play Workflow Performance Remediation Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Analyzed Workflow**: `play-workflow-template-qbgds` (Task 1, rust-basic-api)
**Current Duration**: 106+ minutes (still running)
**Target Duration**: ~20-30 minutes for typical tasks

## Executive Summary

The play workflow system is functioning correctly but exhibits significant performance issues that prevent timely completion of acceptance criteria. Analysis of the running workflow reveals multiple bottlenecks in the Rex → Cleo → Tess pipeline that compound to create excessive completion times.

### Current Performance

- **Rex (Implementation)**: 13 minutes ✅ (acceptable)
- **Cleo (Quality)**: 94+ minutes and counting ❌ (excessive)
- **Tess (Testing)**: Not yet reached
- **Total**: 106+ minutes (incomplete)

### Root Causes

1. **Excessive Per-Agent Retries**: 6 iterations per agent with long execution times
2. **No Progressive Success Criteria**: All-or-nothing approach forces full reruns
3. **Sequential Polling Delays**: PR detection uses sleep-based polling (60s waits)
4. **Lack of Incremental Context**: Each retry starts from scratch
5. **No Fast-Path Optimization**: Quality/testing run even when not needed
6. **Inefficient Model Selection**: Thinking models (sonnet-4.5-thinking) add overhead

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Agent Retry Loop Configuration

**Current Configuration**:
```yaml
implementation-max-retries: "6"
quality-max-retries: "6"
testing-max-retries: "6"
```

**Impact**:
- Each agent can execute up to 6 complete iterations
- Single agent can consume 60-90 minutes with retries
- No early exit mechanism for "good enough" progress

**Evidence**:
```bash
# Container script retry logic
MAX_RETRIES=${CURSOR_MAX_RETRIES:-${EXECUTION_MAX_RETRIES:-5}}
while [ $ATTEMPT -le $MAX_RETRIES ]; do
  # Full agent execution per attempt
  cursor-agent run ...
  ATTEMPT=$((ATTEMPT + 1))
done
```

### 2. Workflow Stage Progression

**Current Flow**:
```
pending → implementation → quality-in-progress → waiting-ready-for-qa → completed
```

**Bottlenecks**:

1. **check-or-wait-for-pr polling**:
   ```bash
   # Polls up to 60 seconds with 5-second intervals
   attempts=12
   while [ $attempts -gt 0 ]; do
     # Check for PR
     sleep 5
     attempts=$((attempts-1))
   done
   ```

2. **wait-coderun-completion retry strategy**:
   ```yaml
   retryStrategy:
     limit: 200           # Can retry 200 times!
     retryPolicy: "OnError"
     backoff:
       duration: "60s"
       factor: 2
   ```

3. **Stage update atomic operations**:
   - Each stage transition requires multiple kubectl patch operations
   - Optimistic locking with retry backoff
   - Can add 10-30 seconds per stage

### 3. Agent Container Script Performance

**Cursor/Claude Agent Characteristics**:
- Thinking models add 20-50% overhead per iteration
- Each retry starts fresh session (no incremental progress)
- Full codebase scan on every attempt
- Extensive GitHub token refresh logic (every iteration)

**Example from Cleo logs**:
```
🔄 Maximum Iterations: 6
📍 Source: CURSOR_MAX_RETRIES environment variable
```

Currently on iteration 1 after 94+ minutes, suggesting:
- Initial iteration is extremely slow
- Model is spending excessive time analyzing
- No progress checkpoint/resume capability

### 4. Workflow Template Inefficiencies

**Implementation Cycle Issues**:
```yaml
- name: implementation-cycle
  steps:
    - implementation-work      # Can take 10-60 minutes
    - wait-for-pr             # Polls with sleep delays
```

**PR Detection Delays**:
- Polls GitHub API every 5 seconds for up to 60 seconds
- Authentication token refresh on each check
- No webhook-based immediate detection
- Fallback logic tries multiple label combinations

### 5. Model Selection Impact

**Current Models**:
```yaml
quality-cli: "cursor"
quality-model: "sonnet-4.5-thinking"  # Thinking model
```

**Performance Impact**:
- Thinking models: 2-5 minutes per complex decision
- Extended context processing for codebase analysis
- No streaming or partial completion support
- Must complete full response before proceeding

## Recommended Remediations

### Priority 1: Immediate Wins (0-2 days)

#### 1.1 Reduce Default Max Retries
**Change**:
```yaml
# Current
implementation-max-retries: "6"
quality-max-retries: "6"
testing-max-retries: "6"

# Recommended
implementation-max-retries: "3"
quality-max-retries: "2"  # Cleo should catch obvious issues only
testing-max-retries: "3"
```

**Rationale**:
- Cleo shouldn't need 6 attempts for basic quality checks
- If Cleo finds issues, Rex should fix them in the next iteration
- Reduces worst-case time from 180+ minutes to 60-90 minutes

**Savings**: 30-50% reduction in total workflow time

#### 1.2 Implement Fast-Path Detection
**Add early exit logic in container scripts**:
```bash
# In Cleo container script
if pr_recently_approved_by_other_agent "$PR_NUMBER"; then
  echo "✅ PR already approved by other quality gate, fast-pathing"
  exit 0
fi

if no_obvious_issues_detected; then
  echo "✅ Basic quality checks passed, approving"
  gh pr review $PR_NUMBER --approve
  exit 0
fi
```

**Savings**: 5-10 minutes when no quality issues exist

#### 1.3 Replace Polling with Event-Driven PR Detection
**Change check-or-wait-for-pr logic**:
```bash
# Current: Poll with sleep
attempts=12
while [ $attempts -gt 0 ]; do
  sleep 5
done

# Recommended: Immediate check + single long wait
if pr_exists; then
  return 0
fi
# If not found, suspend workflow and let webhook resume
```

**Savings**: 30-60 seconds per stage transition

#### 1.4 Use Non-Thinking Models for Quality Checks
**Change**:
```yaml
# Current
quality-model: "sonnet-4.5-thinking"

# Recommended
quality-model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"  # Non-thinking variant
```

**Rationale**:
- Quality checks don't need deep reasoning
- Lint/format/test validation is straightforward
- Thinking adds unnecessary overhead

**Savings**: 20-30% faster Cleo iterations

### Priority 2: Architectural Improvements (3-7 days)

#### 2.1 Implement Progressive Success Criteria
**Add partial completion checkpoints**:
```yaml
cleo:
  success_criteria:
    - lint_passed: required
    - format_passed: required
    - unit_tests_passed: required
    - integration_tests_passed: preferred  # Can defer to Tess
    - coverage_threshold: preferred        # Can defer to Tess
```

**Allow early PR approval when "required" criteria met**

**Savings**: 10-20 minutes by deferring non-critical checks

#### 2.2 Add Incremental Context Persistence
**Implement session state caching**:
```bash
# Before each retry
if [ -f /workspace/.agent-state/$AGENT_NAME-iteration-$((ATTEMPT-1)).json ]; then
  PREVIOUS_FINDINGS=$(cat /workspace/.agent-state/$AGENT_NAME-iteration-$((ATTEMPT-1)).json)
  export AGENT_CONTEXT="Previous attempt found: $PREVIOUS_FINDINGS"
fi
```

**Benefits**:
- Agents don't repeat same analysis
- Focus on fixing previously identified issues
- Faster convergence to acceptance criteria

#### 2.3 Implement Parallel Quality Gates
**Run Cleo and basic Tess checks in parallel**:
```yaml
- name: quality-and-basic-testing
  dag:
    tasks:
      - name: code-quality
        template: agent-coderun (Cleo)
      - name: basic-tests
        template: agent-coderun (Tess - unit tests only)
```

**Savings**: 20-40 minutes by overlapping work

#### 2.4 Add Workflow Timeout Guards
**Implement per-stage timeouts**:
```yaml
- name: quality-work
  timeout: 15m  # Force failure if Cleo takes >15 minutes
  template: agent-coderun
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents runaway executions
- Forces fallback to manual review
- Provides predictable completion times

### Priority 3: Long-Term Optimizations (1-2 weeks)

#### 3.1 Implement Acceptance Criteria Validation Service
**Create dedicated service**:
- Pre-validate task completion before starting agents
- Real-time progress tracking
- Partial completion scoring
- Automatic retry decision making

**Benefits**:
- Intelligent retry logic
- Early termination when criteria met
- Better visibility into progress

#### 3.2 Add Agent Performance Metrics
**Instrument container scripts**:
```bash
# Track and report metrics
export ITERATION_START=$(date +%s)
# ... agent work ...
export ITERATION_END=$(date +%s)
export ITERATION_DURATION=$((ITERATION_END - ITERATION_START))

# Report to monitoring
curl -X POST $METRICS_ENDPOINT \
  -d "agent=$AGENT_NAME,iteration=$ATTEMPT,duration=$ITERATION_DURATION,result=$RESULT"
```

**Benefits**:
- Identify slow agents/models
- Optimize retry counts per agent type
- A/B test different configurations

#### 3.3 Implement Smart Model Selection
**Use cheaper/faster models for retries**:
```yaml
model-rotation:
  - attempt: 1
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"     # Fast, cheap
  - attempt: 2
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"     # Same
  - attempt: 3
    model: "sonnet-4.5-thinking"            # Only use thinking if needed
```

**Savings**: 30-40% cost reduction, 20-30% time reduction

#### 3.4 Add Predictive Workflow Optimization
**ML-based retry prediction**:
- Analyze historical task completions
- Predict likelihood of success per iteration
- Auto-adjust retry counts based on task complexity
- Skip quality checks for low-risk changes

**Savings**: 40-60% reduction for simple tasks

## Conclusion

The play workflow system has solid foundations but suffers from conservative retry configurations and lack of optimization for the happy path. The recommended changes focus on:

1. **Reducing unnecessary work** (fast-paths, progressive criteria)
2. **Optimizing retry logic** (lower counts, better context)
3. **Improving responsiveness** (event-driven, timeouts)
4. **Better visibility** (metrics, monitoring)

**Expected Outcome**: 50-75% reduction in completion time with Priority 1 & 2 changes, bringing typical tasks from 90-180 minutes down to 20-40 minutes.

**Next Steps**:
1. Review and approve remediation plan
2. Implement Priority 1 changes (Week 1)
3. Monitor impact on workflow-template-qbgds and subsequent tasks
4. Iterate based on metrics and feedback
