## Analysis

This presents a clear implementation opportunity for our platform. We could build web monitoring agents that integrate with our existing agent orchestration system. The concept of AI agents that continuously monitor web changes aligns perfectly with our multi-agent architecture. We could implement this as specialized monitoring agents (similar to Rex/Blaze/Tess) that use web scraping, change detection, and notification systems. The mentioned tech stack (Firecrawl for web scraping, AI SDK for intelligence, Resend for notifications) provides a concrete implementation path. This would add valuable monitoring capabilities to our platform and could be orchestrated through our existing Kubernetes/Argo Workflows infrastructure.

**Implementation Potential**: 🔍 Worth Investigating (0.85)
