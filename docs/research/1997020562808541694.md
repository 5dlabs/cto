## Analysis

GPT-5.1 Codex Max represents a significant upgrade for agentic coding capabilities that could directly enhance our AI agents (Rex, Blaze, Tess). The model's improved reasoning and token efficiency for long-running tasks aligns perfectly with our multi-agent orchestration needs. We could integrate this as a new model option in our agent configurations, potentially improving code generation quality and reducing costs through better token efficiency. The Vercel AI Gateway integration suggests standardized API patterns we could adopt.

**Implementation Potential**: 🔍 Worth Investigating (0.85)
