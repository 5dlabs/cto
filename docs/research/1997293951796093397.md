> Running Go Services on Kubernetes: What You Need to Know

## Analysis

While our platform is primarily Rust-based, Go service patterns on Kubernetes could inform our agent deployment strategies. The content likely covers service mesh, monitoring, and orchestration patterns that could be adapted for our Rust-based agents. However, without Go being a primary language in our stack, the direct implementation value is limited. Could provide insights for improving our Kubernetes operators or agent lifecycle management.

**Implementation Potential**: 📌 Low Priority (0.60)

### 💡 Implementation Ideas

- Adapt Go service deployment patterns for Rust agent containers
- Implement similar health check and readiness probe strategies for our agents
- Extract Kubernetes resource management patterns for our agent orchestration
- Apply service discovery patterns to improve agent-to-agent communication
- Implement similar monitoring and observability patterns for agent lifecycle management
