# Research: LLM integration

## Analysis

This Obsidian plugin demonstrates a pattern we could implement: integrating LLM capabilities directly into developer documentation and knowledge management workflows. While we don't use Obsidian specifically, the core concept of embedding AI assistance into markdown-based documentation tools is highly relevant. We could build similar MCP tools that integrate ChatGPT/local LLMs into our agents' documentation generation, code commenting, and knowledge base management. The plugin likely shows practical patterns for handling LLM API integration, markdown processing, and context management that we could adapt for our Rust-based toolchain.

**Implementation Potential**: 🔍 Worth Investigating (0.75)
