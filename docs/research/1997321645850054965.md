## Analysis

NGINX Gateway Fabric could be valuable for our multi-agent platform's ingress and traffic management. Since we use Kubernetes and orchestrate multiple AI agents, implementing Gateway API with NGINX could improve how we route requests to different agents (Rex, Blaze, Tess), provide better load balancing for agent workloads, and offer more sophisticated traffic splitting for A/B testing different agent versions. The Gateway API is the future of Kubernetes ingress, so this could modernize our networking stack.

**Implementation Potential**: 🔍 Worth Investigating (0.75)
