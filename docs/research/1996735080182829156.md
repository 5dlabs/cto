# Research: TanStack AI

## Original Tweet

> I'm extremely excited about what's coming up with @tan_stack AI. We are just getting started and if you are as passionate about AI and making it easy for anyone to build incredible agentic experiences, jump on in and help out!

## Analysis

TanStack AI is a new framework from the TanStack team (known for React Query, Table, etc.) focused on building agentic experiences. While this tweet is promotional without implementation details, TanStack's track record suggests they're building developer-friendly abstractions for AI agents. This could be highly relevant for our multi-agent platform - we could potentially integrate TanStack AI patterns, adopt their agent orchestration approaches, or build MCP tools that work with their framework. The timing is perfect as they're 'just getting started', meaning we could influence direction or early adopt patterns.

**Implementation Potential**: 🔍 Worth Investigating (0.80)

### 💡 Implementation Ideas

- Investigate TanStack AI framework for agent orchestration patterns we could adopt
- Build MCP tools that integrate with TanStack AI ecosystem
- Evaluate their agent communication patterns for our Rex/Blaze/Tess coordination
- Consider contributing to TanStack AI to influence multi-agent use cases
- Explore their developer experience patterns for our platform's agent management UI
