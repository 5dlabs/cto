# Research: MCP server

## Original Tweet

> An MCP server that detects production-grade code quality issues in real-time!

## Analysis

This directly addresses a critical pain point in our multi-agent platform - code quality validation of AI-generated code. We could implement an MCP server that integrates with our existing agents (Rex, Blaze, Tess) to provide real-time code quality analysis. This would add significant value by catching issues before they reach human review, reducing the debugging bottleneck mentioned. The real-time aspect suggests streaming analysis that could integrate with our Argo Workflows for continuous validation.

**Implementation Potential**: 🔍 Worth Investigating (0.85)
