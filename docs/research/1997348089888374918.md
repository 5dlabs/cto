## Analysis

This appears to reference a Google guide on context engineering for multi-agent systems, which is directly relevant to our platform. Context engineering is a critical challenge for our AI coding agents (Rex, Blaze, Tess) and could significantly improve their performance. The mention of 'long-horizon' tasks suggests techniques for maintaining context across extended development workflows, which is exactly what we need for complex software projects. While the tweet is truncated, Google's technical guides typically contain actionable implementation patterns we could adapt.

**Implementation Potential**: 🔍 Worth Investigating (0.85)
