## Analysis

This describes a multi-agent orchestration pattern with specialized roles that we could directly implement. The concept of having a primary orchestrator (Sisyphus) that delegates work, plus specialized subagents (read-only planner, strategic advisor) maps well to our Rex/Blaze/Tess architecture. We could implement similar role-based delegation patterns, create read-only planning modes for our agents, and add strategic advisory capabilities. The naming suggests this is from an actual implementation (oh-my-opencode) rather than theoretical, making it more actionable.
