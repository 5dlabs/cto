# Research: tool input examples

## Original Tweet

> AI SDK 6 beta: tool input examples middleware
> 
> Currently only Anthropic supports tool input examples  in their API.
> 
> For other providers, you can use the addToolInputExamplesMiddleware which injects the examples into the tool description.

## Analysis

This is highly actionable for our AI agent platform. Tool input examples are crucial for improving LLM agent performance by providing concrete usage patterns. We could implement a similar middleware system in our agent orchestration layer to standardize tool examples across different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). This would directly improve our agents' tool usage accuracy and reduce hallucination in function calling. The middleware pattern is also valuable for our MCP tool integration architecture.

**Implementation Potential**: 🔍 Worth Investigating (0.85)

### 💡 Implementation Ideas

- Build a tool input examples middleware for our agent framework to standardize examples across LLM providers
- Create an MCP tool that automatically generates and manages tool input examples for our agent workflows
- Implement a provider-agnostic tool description enhancement system in our agent orchestration layer
- Add tool example validation and testing capabilities to our agent development workflow
- Integrate tool input examples into our existing MCP tool registry and discovery system
