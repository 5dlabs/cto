# Research: multi-agent systems

## Original Tweet

> Building a Deep Research Agent with @MiniMax__AI  M2.1 + @tavilyai 
> 
> High Level Overview:
> 1- Orchestrator Agent — Plans research, decomposes query into parallel sub-tasks
> 2- Perspective Mining — Generate diverse viewpoints before searching (STORM pattern)
> 3- Parallel Research

## Analysis

This describes a multi-agent research pattern that directly maps to our platform architecture. The orchestrator agent pattern aligns with our existing agent coordination, and the STORM perspective mining technique could significantly enhance our agents' research capabilities. The parallel research execution fits our Kubernetes/Argo workflow model. We could implement this as a new MCP tool for research tasks or enhance existing agents with these research patterns.

**Implementation Potential**: 🔍 Worth Investigating (0.85)
