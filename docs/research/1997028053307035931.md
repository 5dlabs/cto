# Research: slash commands

## Original Tweet

> What if we made custom slash commands easier to write? 
> 
> - Type /add-prompt to get a sidecar editor
> - Add arguments with helpful descriptions
> - Fuzzy find saved prompts with `/`
> - Cycle through arguments with shift+tab

## Analysis

This describes a sophisticated command interface pattern that could significantly improve how developers interact with our AI agents. We could implement a slash command system for agent orchestration - /deploy-agent, /create-workflow, /debug-pipeline etc. The sidecar editor concept could be adapted for our agent configuration UI, and the fuzzy finding for saved prompts maps directly to reusable agent templates or workflow patterns. The argument cycling with shift+tab would improve UX for complex agent commands with multiple parameters.

**Implementation Potential**: 🔍 Worth Investigating (0.85)

### 💡 Implementation Ideas

- Build a slash command interface for agent orchestration (/deploy-rex, /run-workflow, /debug-agent)
- Create a sidecar editor for configuring agent parameters and workflow definitions
- Implement fuzzy search for saved agent templates, workflow patterns, and MCP tool configurations
- Add keyboard shortcuts for cycling through command arguments in our agent CLI tools
- Develop a command palette system for discovering available agent actions and tools
- Create reusable prompt templates that can be invoked via slash commands for different agent types
