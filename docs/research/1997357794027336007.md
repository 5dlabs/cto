# Research: agent memory

## Original Tweet

> this is a nice / simple pattern for agent memory. reflect over session logs, distill  preferences / feedback from actual use to update memory. been doing this w/ Claude Code for ~1-2 months and very effective. write up + code:

## Analysis

This describes a concrete agent memory pattern that could significantly improve our AI agents' performance over time. The approach of reflecting on session logs to distill preferences and feedback into persistent memory is directly applicable to our multi-agent platform. We could implement this as a memory service that processes agent interaction logs, extracts patterns/preferences using LLM reflection, and maintains persistent agent memory that improves decision-making. The author has real-world experience (1-2 months) proving effectiveness, and the linked writeup likely contains implementation details we could adapt.

### 💡 Implementation Ideas

- Build a memory reflection service that processes agent session logs to extract user preferences and feedback patterns
- Implement persistent agent memory storage that gets updated based on distilled insights from interactions
- Create a reflection workflow that periodically analyzes agent logs and updates memory with learned preferences
- Add memory-aware decision making to our agents that considers historical preferences when generating responses
- Develop a feedback loop system where agent performance improves over time through memory accumulation
- Integrate this pattern into our existing agent orchestration to make Rex, Blaze, Tess more personalized and effective
