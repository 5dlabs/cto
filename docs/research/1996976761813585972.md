# Research: agent delegation

## Original Tweet

> Agents on @linear you can now use and delegate engineering tasks to:
> @tembo 
> @Sentry
> @codegen
> @cursor_ai
> @FactoryAI
> @github Copilot
> @OpenAI Codex
> @cognition Devin 
> + more

## Analysis

This tweet reveals Linear's agent delegation architecture which we could implement in our platform. The concept of allowing agents to delegate tasks to specialized external services (Sentry for monitoring, GitHub for code management, etc.) is highly actionable. We could build a similar delegation system where our agents (Rex, Blaze, Tess) can automatically route tasks to appropriate external tools based on task type. This would require building MCP connectors for these services and implementing a task routing/delegation layer in our orchestration system.

**Implementation Potential**: 🔍 Worth Investigating (0.85)
