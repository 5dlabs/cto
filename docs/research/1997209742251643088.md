## Analysis

This tweet references a paper on 'Fundamentals of Building Autonomous LLM Agents' which could contain valuable architectural patterns and implementation strategies for our multi-agent platform. The mention of 'true autonomy' not being about bigger models but about 'giving an [agent]' something specific suggests concrete implementation approaches. While the tweet is cut off, the paper likely contains actionable insights about agent architecture, decision-making frameworks, and autonomy patterns that we could implement in our Rex/Blaze/Tess agent orchestration system.

**Implementation Potential**: 🔍 Worth Investigating (0.80)
