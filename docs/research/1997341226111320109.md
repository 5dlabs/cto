## Analysis

Rebuilding VSCode from first principles is highly relevant for our multi-agent platform. We could implement a custom IDE/editor interface specifically designed for AI agent workflows, with features like real-time agent collaboration visualization, workflow debugging interfaces, and agent-specific tooling. This could integrate with our Kubernetes orchestration to provide live views of agent execution, MCP tool usage, and code generation processes. The implementation would likely involve Rust-based backend services with a modern web frontend, perfectly aligned with our tech stack.
