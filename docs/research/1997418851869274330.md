# Research: context engineering

## Original Tweet

> Google's new ADK context engineering doc is a great guide for production agent builders.

> The most essential advice is to separate what you store from what the model sees. Your session holds everything, every tool call, every user turn, every intermediate result. But the working

## Analysis

This tweet references Google's ADK context engineering documentation which likely contains specific patterns for managing agent context and memory - directly applicable to our multi-agent platform. The mention of separating 'what you store from what the model sees' suggests concrete architectural patterns we could implement for better context management across Rex, Blaze, Tess, etc. This could improve our agents' performance and memory efficiency.

**Implementation Potential**: 🔍 Worth Investigating (0.85)
