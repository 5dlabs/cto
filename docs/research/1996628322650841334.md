## Analysis

Reloader is a highly relevant Kubernetes controller that could significantly improve our platform's configuration management. Since we use Kubernetes and Argo Workflows with AI agents that likely depend on ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration, this tool could automate the tedious process of manually restarting deployments when configs change. We could either integrate the existing Reloader controller or build our own custom version tailored to our multi-agent platform needs. This would improve developer experience and reduce manual intervention in our CI/CD pipelines.

**Implementation Potential**: 🔍 Worth Investigating (0.85)

### 💡 Implementation Ideas

- Deploy Reloader controller in our Kubernetes clusters to auto-restart agent pods when configs change
