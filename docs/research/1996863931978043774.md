# Research: agent configuration

## Original Tweet

> When developing agents, these three components are the most crucial:
> 1. System Prompt (persona, tasks, examples…)
> 2. Tool prompts (how/when to use the tool, what to retrieve, how to present the findings…)
> 3. Protocols (which tools to chain, what are the constraints,

## Analysis

This tweet outlines a structured framework for agent development that we could implement as a formal configuration system in our platform. The three-component model (System Prompt, Tool Prompts, Protocols) maps directly to how we could standardize and improve our agent orchestration. We could build a configuration management system that enforces this structure, create templates for each component, and develop tooling to help developers optimize these elements. This would improve consistency across our Rex, Blaze, Tess agents and make agent behavior more predictable and maintainable.
