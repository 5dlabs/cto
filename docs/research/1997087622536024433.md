# Research: CLI tools

## Original Tweet

> Tonight is CLI tool building night. Was tired of the Google captcha, so created a new simple search CLI that scra... uses Brave. For API docs and other code related stuff, the results are largely on-par with Google. Bonus point for page content fetching.

## Analysis

This is a CLI tool for search that could be valuable as an MCP tool for our agents. The ability to search and fetch page content programmatically would enhance our agents' research capabilities. Since it's designed to avoid Google captcha issues and provides API docs/code search, it could be integrated as a search MCP tool that our coding agents (Rex, Blaze, Tess) could use for documentation lookup, code examples, and technical research during development tasks.

**Implementation Potential**: 🔍 Worth Investigating (0.85)

### 💡 Implementation Ideas

- Build an MCP tool wrapper around this search CLI for agent integration
- Create a search service that agents can call for documentation and code examples
- Integrate as part of our research workflow for agents needing external information
- Adapt the page content fetching capability for automated documentation gathering
- Use as a fallback search mechanism when other APIs are rate-limited
