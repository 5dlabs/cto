# Research: Rust

## Original Tweet

> The Solana ecosystem is growing and I project Solana Security Audits demand will grow >30% for many in 2026. Great time to learn Rust auditing.
>
> Here is your latest and greatest resource on this, start digging. Great Job, @0xhuy0512

## Analysis

While this tweet is about Solana security auditing rather than direct platform features, it presents a moderate implementation opportunity. We could build Rust-based security analysis tools or MCP integrations for smart contract auditing that our agents could use. The Rust connection is relevant to our stack, and security tooling could differentiate our platform. However, it's more of a specialized domain extension rather than core platform improvement.

**Implementation Potential**: 📌 Low Priority (0.60)

### 💡 Implementation Ideas

- Build MCP tools for Solana smart contract security analysis
- Integrate Rust-based static analysis libraries for security auditing
- Create specialized agents for blockchain security reviews
- Develop workflow templates for smart contract audit processes
- Add security-focused code analysis capabilities to existing agents
