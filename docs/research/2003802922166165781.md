# Research: multi-agent orchestration

## Analysis

This is highly relevant to our multi-agent platform. The author is building a control panel for orchestrating multiple AI agents, which directly addresses a core need in our platform. The concept of 'taking a higher level view' rather than being 'in individual agent repos and chat' aligns perfectly with our orchestration challenges. The GitHub repo likely contains architectural patterns, UI/UX approaches, and orchestration logic we could adapt for managing Rex, Blaze, Tess, and other agents. This could inform our dashboard design, agent monitoring, and workflow visualization capabilities.

**Implementation Potential**: 🔍 Worth Investigating (0.85)
