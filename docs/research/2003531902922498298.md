# Research: TUI

## Original Tweet

> opencode is literally-literally and order of magnitude ahead of every single coding TUI in terms of UX. the gap is just insane. i so so so badly want them to be acquired my anthropic

## Analysis

This tweet mentions 'opencode' as having superior UX for coding TUIs (Terminal User Interfaces). While we could potentially investigate their UX patterns and design principles for our own developer tooling interfaces, the tweet lacks specific technical details about what makes their UX superior. The mention of acquisition by Anthropic suggests it's a notable tool, but without concrete implementation details or specific features mentioned, this is more of a general endorsement than actionable technical content. We could research opencode's interface patterns for potential inspiration in our agent interaction UIs.

**Implementation Potential**: 📌 Low Priority (0.60)

### 💡 Implementation Ideas

- Research opencode's TUI design patterns for our agent command interfaces
- Investigate their UX principles for improving our developer dashboard
- Analyze their terminal-based workflow patterns for agent interaction design
- Consider building enhanced TUI components for our platform's CLI tools
