## Analysis

This Google guide on context engineering for multi-agent systems directly applies to our platform's core challenge of orchestrating AI coding agents efficiently. Context engineering techniques could significantly improve our agent coordination, reduce token costs, and minimize hallucinations across Rex, Blaze, Tess, etc. The mention of 'compiled view over state' suggests concrete architectural patterns we could implement in our Rust-based orchestration layer. This could lead to better agent memory management, more efficient prompt construction, and improved inter-agent communication protocols.

**Implementation Potential**: 🔍 Worth Investigating (0.85)
