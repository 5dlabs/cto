# Research: context management

## Original Tweet

> PSA: Clean your CLAUDE .md regularly
> 
> This is critical and most devs miss it: CLAUDE .md captures your codebase state from the FIRST run. As your code evolves, that file becomes stale.
> 
> Claude keeps getting fed outdated context and bugs compound exponentially.

## Analysis

This highlights a critical context management issue that directly affects our AI agents. We could implement automated context freshness tracking, stale file detection, and context cleanup workflows. This would prevent our agents from working with outdated codebase snapshots and improve code quality over time.
