# Research: CI/CD

## Analysis

Tophat is a mobile app testing tool that could inspire valuable CI/CD automation patterns for our platform. While we don't directly build mobile apps, the core concept of automatically installing and testing artifacts from CI pipelines is highly relevant. We could implement similar patterns for: 1) Automatically deploying and testing web applications generated by our agents, 2) Creating validation workflows that test agent-generated code in isolated environments, 3) Building a testing orchestration system that validates multi-component applications our agents create. The tool demonstrates sophisticated artifact management and automated testing workflows that could enhance our Argo Workflows and Kubernetes-based testing infrastructure.

**Implementation Potential**: 🔍 Worth Investigating (0.80)

### 💡 Implementation Ideas

- Build a similar artifact testing system for web applications generated by our agents
- Create automated deployment and validation workflows for agent-generated code
- Implement artifact management patterns for testing multi-component applications
- Develop testing orchestration workflows that validate agent outputs in isolated environments
- Integrate automated testing feedback loops into our agent development workflows

[Permalink:\
Tophat\
](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/#------tophat---)

As seen on the [Shopify Engineering Blog](https://shopify.engineering/shopify-tophat-mobile-developer-testing)!

[![Artwork](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/raw/main/media/banner.png)](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/blob/main/media/banner.png)

**Tophat is the best way to install and test any mobile application. Just add CI.**

### One-Click Installation

[Permalink: One-Click Installation](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/#one-click-installation)

With Tophat, you can skip building branches locally. Use Tophatʼs many features and APIs to easily create installation links to CI artifacts. Take your tooling a step further and offer contributors the ability to test pull requests without cloning anything!

### Extensions

[Permalink: Extensions](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/#extensions)

With the [TophatKit](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/blob/main/TophatKit) SDK, you can easily extend Tophat to integrate with custom build and caching systems. This makes Tophat compatible with virtually any tooling setup you can imagine!

### Quick Launch

[Permalink: Quick Launch](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/#quick-launch)

Quick Launch allows you to add your favourite apps right to the Tophat menu. Need the latest build? Click on the icon and go! Tophat will download the latest version, automatically update the icon, and launch it on your device.

[![Quick Launch](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/raw/main/media/quick_launch.png)](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/blob/main/media/quick_launch.png)

### Device Pinning

[Permalink: Device Pinning](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/#device-pinning)

Have lots of devices and only use a couple at a time? Easily pin them to the top of the devices list for quick access.

[![Device Pinning](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/raw/main/media/device_pinning.png)](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/blob/main/media/device_pinning.png)

### Customize

[Permalink: Customize](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/#customize)

Customize Tophat to your needs with the Settings window. Adjust preferences, add apps to Quick Launch, or even specify custom tooling paths to make Tophat work for your environment.

[![Settings](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/raw/main/media/settings.png)](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/blob/main/media/settings.png)

## Integrating Tophat

[Permalink: Integrating Tophat](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/#integrating-tophat)

> 💡 The following APIs have been introduced in Tophat 2. Legacy APIs have been removed.

Downloads with Tophat are powered by **_artifact providers_**. Some providers are built-in to Tophat, while some can be installed using Tophat Extensions (see [_Extensions_](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/#extensions)). When triggering an install with Tophat, you will need to specify the following information:

- The providerʼs ID.
- The providerʼs parameters.
- The platform (optional).
- The destination (optional).
- A list of launch arguments (optional).

The format by which this information is specified varies slightly depending on whether you use URLs, Quick Launch, or `tophatctl`, but each API requires roughly the same information.

You can view a list of all artifact provider IDs using `tophatctl list providers`.

Each request can install multiple artifacts. Within each request, these are called _recipes_, and are particularly useful when you want to have one link that supports both simulators and devices in the same link, where different builds are required for each.

### URLs

[Permalink: URLs](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/#urls)

Tophat handles URLs using both the `tophat://` and `http://` schemes so that you can use them in any website or application. Where possible, prefer the `tophat://` scheme which does not navigate away from the current page.

The examples below will use `tophat://`, but `tophat://` is interchangeable with `http://localhost:29070/` for use with GitHub, for example.

> 📝 When creating an install link, prefer using “Install with Tophat” as the link text.

#### URL Format

[Permalink: URL Format](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/#url-format)

Below is an example for a hypothetical artifact provider for Google Cloud Storage. In this case, `gcs` is the artifact provider ID:

```
tophat://install/gcs?bucket=<bucket>&object=<object>
```

The type of build downloaded will be interpreted by Tophat automatically, but the API provides a means to preheat the intended device ahead of time by specifying the platform and destination:

```
tophat://install/gcs?bucket=<bucket>&object=<object>&platform=ios&destination=device
```

If multiple artifacts are created for different destinations, parameters for both artifacts may be specified in the same URL by repeating query parameters. Tophat will then select the appropriate parameters for the selected device.

```
tophat://install/gcs?bucket=<bucket>&object=<object>&platform=ios&destination=device&bucket=<bucket>&object=<object>&platform=ios&destination=simulator
```

Launch arguments may be specified using the `arguments` query parameter:

```
tophat://install/gcs?bucket=<bucket>&object=<object>&arguments=one,two,three
```

On iOS, these arguments are retrievable using `ProcessInfo`. On Android, these arguments are delivered to your appʼs main activity _via_ intent argument extras in the `TOPHAT_ARGUMENTS` key as an array of strings.

## Using Tophat

[Permalink: Using Tophat](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/#using-tophat)

### Core Providers

[Permalink: Core Providers](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/#core-providers)

Some core providers are built-in to Tophat. These provide a balance between ease of use and flexibility.

#### Basic HTTP

[Permalink: Basic HTTP](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/#basic-http)

```
tophat://install/http?url=<full_public_url>
```

#### Shell Script

[Permalink: Shell Script](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/#shell-script)

A shell script allows you to have full control over how the artifact is downloaded. Shell scripts are placed in `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.shopify.Tophat.TophatCoreExtension/` and must have their executable flags set with `chmod +x <filename>`.

For example, a shell script with filename `filename` placed in the location described above can be invoked using:

```
tophat://install/shell?script=filename
```

The script is provided with two positional arguments:

- `$1` is a full path to a **staging** directory where you may temporarily store files during download and unzip.
- `$2` is a full path to the **output** directory where exactly one artifact must be located when the script finishes. Tophat will look in this directory to install the application.

### Command Line Helper

[Permalink: Command Line Helper](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/#command-line-helper)

Tophat can be integrated with various tools and projects using `tophatctl`, Tophatʼs companion command line app. You can use `tophatctl` to perform the following tasks:

- **Manage Quick Launch apps.** Pre-populate Tophat with your projectʼs apps in a `dev up` step.
- **Install apps.** Install an app by URL or path.
- **List providers.** Display provider configuration to assist with integration.

For more details on how to use `tophatctl`, run the following command after installing the Command Line Helper:

```
tophatctl --help
```

### File Associations

[Permalink: File Associations](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/#file-associations)

Tophat also adds file associations to `*.ipa`, `*.apk`, and `*.zip` files so you can open artifacts from your device.
