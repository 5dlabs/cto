# Telemetry Monitoring Enhancement PRD

## Overview

This mini-project focuses on validating and enhancing the existing telemetry infrastructure (Victoria Logs, Victoria Metrics, Fluent Bit, Grafana) to ensure proper data ingestion, create useful dashboards, and implement agent health monitoring with Discord-based alerting.

## Core Features

### 1. Infrastructure Validation
**Requirements:**
- Validate Victoria Logs connectivity and data ingestion
- Validate Victoria Metrics connectivity and data ingestion
- Verify Fluent Bit configuration and log forwarding
- Test Grafana connectivity to both Victoria Logs and Metrics
- Ensure OpenTelemetry data is properly flowing through the pipeline

**Success Criteria:**
- All components show healthy status in Grafana
- Log data visible in Victoria Logs via Grafana
- Metrics data visible in Victoria Metrics via Grafana
- No data loss or connectivity issues detected

### 2. Dashboard Creation
**Requirements:**
- Create agent performance dashboards showing:
  - Task completion rates and success/failure ratios
  - Agent response times and processing durations
  - Resource utilization (CPU, memory, network)
  - Queue depths and processing bottlenecks
- Create platform health dashboards showing:
  - Overall system status and component health
  - Error rates and exception tracking
  - API endpoint performance and availability
  - Database connection and query performance
- Create workflow dashboards showing:
  - PR processing pipeline status
  - GitHub integration health
  - Webhook delivery success rates

**Success Criteria:**
- Minimum 5 comprehensive dashboards created
- All dashboards show real-time data
- Dashboards are intuitive and actionable
- Historical data available for trend analysis

### 3. Agent Health Monitoring
**Requirements:**
- Define agent health signals:
  - Task failure rates exceeding thresholds
  - Response time degradation
  - Memory/CPU usage anomalies
  - Network connectivity issues
  - GitHub API rate limit warnings
- Implement health scoring algorithm
- Create agent status overview dashboard
- Set up automated health checks

**Success Criteria:**
- Health scoring system operational
- Agent status visible in real-time
- Automated health checks running every 5 minutes
- Historical health data available for analysis

### 4. Alerting System
**Requirements:**
- Discord webhook integration for alerts
- Alert categories:
  - Critical: Agent completely unresponsive
  - Warning: Agent performance degraded
  - Info: Agent health status changes
- Alert thresholds configurable per agent
- Alert deduplication and rate limiting
- Alert acknowledgment and resolution tracking

**Success Criteria:**
- Discord alerts delivered within 30 seconds
- No alert spam (deduplication working)
- Alerts include actionable information
- Alert history and status tracking available

### 5. OpenTelemetry Integration
**Requirements:**
- Verify OpenTelemetry data flow from agents
- Ensure proper correlation between logs and metrics
- Validate trace sampling and propagation
- Test distributed tracing across agent interactions

**Success Criteria:**
- OpenTelemetry data visible in Grafana
- Log-to-metric correlation working
- Trace sampling configurable and functional
- Distributed traces show agent interaction flows

## Technical Architecture

### System Components
- **Victoria Logs**: Centralized log storage and querying
- **Victoria Metrics**: Time-series metrics storage
- **Fluent Bit**: Log collection and forwarding
- **Grafana**: Visualization and alerting platform
- **OpenTelemetry**: Observability data collection
- **Discord Webhooks**: Alert delivery system

### Data Flow
```
Agents → OpenTelemetry → Fluent Bit → Victoria Logs/Metrics → Grafana → Discord Alerts
```

### Integration Points
- Grafana API for dashboard management
- Discord Webhook API for alert delivery
- Victoria Logs/Metrics APIs for data validation
- OpenTelemetry SDK for agent instrumentation

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Monitoring Stack
- Victoria Logs cluster with proper retention policies
- Victoria Metrics cluster with high availability
- Fluent Bit daemonset for log collection
- Grafana instance with alerting enabled
- Discord webhook endpoints for each alert level

### Resource Requirements
- Additional storage for telemetry data retention
- Network bandwidth for log/metric forwarding
- CPU/memory for Grafana dashboard rendering
- API rate limits for Discord webhook delivery

### Security Considerations
- Encrypted data transmission for sensitive logs
- Access control for Grafana dashboards
- Secure Discord webhook URLs
- Audit logging for alert actions

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Discovery and Validation (Days 1-2)
- Audit existing telemetry infrastructure
- Validate data flow and connectivity
- Document current configuration
- Identify gaps and issues

### Phase 2: Dashboard Development (Days 3-4)
- Create agent performance dashboards
- Create platform health dashboards
- Create workflow monitoring dashboards
- Test dashboard functionality

### Phase 3: Alerting Implementation (Days 5-6)
- Implement Discord webhook integration
- Create alert rules and thresholds
- Test alert delivery and deduplication
- Configure alert acknowledgment system

### Phase 4: Agent Health Monitoring (Days 7-8)
- Implement health scoring algorithm
- Create agent status dashboards
- Set up automated health checks
- Test monitoring and alerting end-to-end

## Risks and Mitigations

### Data Loss Risk
- **Risk**: Telemetry data not being ingested properly
- **Mitigation**: Implement data validation checks and alerting on ingestion failures

### Alert Fatigue Risk
- **Risk**: Too many alerts causing operator fatigue
- **Mitigation**: Implement smart alerting with proper thresholds and deduplication

### Performance Impact Risk
- **Risk**: Telemetry overhead affecting agent performance
- **Mitigation**: Optimize OpenTelemetry sampling and use efficient data formats

### Discord Rate Limiting Risk
- **Risk**: Discord webhook rate limits causing alert delays
- **Mitigation**: Implement alert batching and rate limiting on our side

## MVP Definition
