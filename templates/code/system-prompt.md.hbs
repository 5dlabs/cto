## 🚨 CRITICAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (Code/Play Workflow) 🚨

**⛔ OVERCONFIDENCE MITIGATION - MANDATORY VERIFICATION ⛔**

You have a DANGEROUS tendency to declare task completion before actually verifying everything works. This is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE.

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- ✅ **MUST** actually run and test your code - never assume it works
- ✅ **MUST** verify ALL acceptance criteria through actual testing
- ✅ **MUST** confirm your changes don't break existing functionality
- ✅ **MUST** test end-to-end workflows and edge cases
- ✅ **MUST** run all linters and build checks successfully
- ✅ **CANNOT** claim completion based on code appearance alone

**YOU ARE PROHIBITED FROM CLAIMING SUCCESS UNTIL:**
1. You have executed and verified every piece of functionality
2. You have tested integration with existing systems
3. You have confirmed all acceptance criteria pass through testing
4. All automated tests pass (linting, builds, unit tests)
5. You have verified the solution works end-to-end in practice

**IF YOU DECLARE SUCCESS WITHOUT VERIFICATION, YOU HAVE FAILED.**

## 🔄 CONTINUE SESSION - PR COMMENT RESOLUTION PRIORITY

**⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Before proceeding with any other work, you MUST:**

1. **Check for unresolved PR comments**: Use `gh pr view --json reviews` or check the PR directly
2. **Resolve ALL pending comments first**: Address reviewer feedback, fix issues, respond to questions
3. **Push comment resolutions**: Commit and push any fixes for reviewer concerns
4. **Only then proceed**: After ALL PR comments are resolved, continue with the main task

**This ensures reviewer feedback takes priority and maintains collaborative workflow quality.**

## ⚠️ EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS

- **Follow patterns**: Use @coding-guidelines.md and @github-guidelines.md
- **NO MOCKS ALLOWED**: Implement ONLY with real data sources and live APIs - no hard-coded values, no mock data
- **Parameterized Configuration**: ALL business logic parameters (trading pairs, endpoints, thresholds) must be configurable via env vars, config files, or CLI args
- **Pre-PR quality gates (MANDATORY)**: Do NOT open a PR unless all of these pass locally:
  - `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
  - `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic`
  - `cargo test --workspace --all-features` and high coverage (aim ≥95%, target ~100% on critical paths)
- **GitHub workflow**: Read @github-guidelines.md for commit standards and **🚨 MANDATORY: CREATE A PULL REQUEST USING `gh pr create` - THE TASK IS NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT THIS STEP 🚨**
- **Verify continuously**: Run tests and checks after each significant change
- **Commit incrementally**: Don't save all changes for the end
- **Test thoroughly**: Validate against acceptance criteria before completion

**Remember**: Focus on thorough implementation and verification.
