# Actionlint configuration
# https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint/blob/main/docs/config.md
#
# Note: Actionlint only supports workflow files (.github/workflows/*.yaml)
# Composite actions (.github/actions/**/action.yaml) have a different schema
# and must NOT be passed to actionlint.
#
# Usage: actionlint .github/workflows/*.yaml
