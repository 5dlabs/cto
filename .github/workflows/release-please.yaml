# Release Please - Automated versioning and releases
#
# This workflow:
# 1. Monitors commits to main for conventional commit messages
# 2. Creates/updates a "Release PR" with version bumps and changelog
# 3. When the Release PR is merged, creates a GitHub release with tag
# 4. Triggers downstream workflows (image builds, deployments)
#
# Conventional commit prefixes:
#   feat:     → minor version bump (0.2.0 → 0.3.0)
#   fix:      → patch version bump (0.2.0 → 0.2.1)
#   feat!:    → major version bump (0.2.0 → 1.0.0)
#   chore:    → no version bump (but included in changelog)
#   docs:     → no version bump
#   refactor: → no version bump
#
# Example: "feat(controller): add new task reconciler"
