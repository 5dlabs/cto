# Implement Parallel System Running

## Overview
Run old and new systems in parallel during migration.

## Implementation Guide

### Phase 1: Infrastructure
1. Dual submission:
   - Path configuration
   - System routing
2. Feature flags:
   - Control system
   - Traffic split

### Phase 2: Monitoring
1. Comparison metrics:
   - Performance data
   - Reliability stats
2. Logging:
   - System tracking
   - Job attribution

### Phase 3: Migration
1. Traffic control:
   - Gradual shift
   - Rollback options
2. Validation:
   - Success metrics
   - Acceptance criteria

### Phase 4: Documentation
1. Maintenance docs
2. Migration plan
3. Rollback procedures

## Technical Requirements
- Support both systems
- Enable feature flags
- Compare performance
- Allow rollback
