# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Cleanup Procedures for Old Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 17
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop and execute procedures to safely remove old components after the migration is complete and extensive validation of the new system confirms it works perfectly.
# Details:
This is the final step after confirming the new system works perfectly. Wait for complete validation of the parallel running phase before beginning cleanup. Create a checklist for identifying all components to be removed. Develop scripts to safely remove old Kubernetes resources. Create database cleanup procedures if applicable. Implement Git repository cleanup to remove old configuration. Document the cleanup process with verification steps. Create a schedule for phased removal to minimize risk. Implement backup procedures before removal. Define success criteria for the cleanup process. Create monitoring to verify no regressions after removal. Document dependencies that might be affected by removal. Establish a point of no return and ensure all stakeholders sign off before proceeding with irreversible cleanup actions.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that extensive validation of the new system has been completed successfully. Confirm all metrics from the parallel running phase show the new system is stable and reliable. Test cleanup procedures in a staging environment. Verify application functionality after component removal. Validate that backups can be restored if needed. Check for orphaned resources after cleanup. Verify monitoring shows no unexpected changes after removal. Test the system under load after cleanup to ensure performance is maintained. Implement a gradual cleanup approach with validation checkpoints between phases.
