# Task ID: 17
# Title: Create Migration Plan and Cutover Strategy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a detailed migration plan with timeline, cutover steps, and rollback procedures to ensure a smooth transition to the new architecture using a parallel running approach.
# Details:
Create a phased migration plan with clear milestones that implements a parallel running approach. Define a traffic shifting strategy to gradually move users from the old system to the new system. Establish validation checkpoints at each stage of traffic shifting. Define success criteria for each phase. Develop a detailed cutover checklist. Create rollback procedures for each step of the gradual transition. Define communication templates for stakeholders. Identify maintenance windows for critical changes. Create a risk assessment with mitigation strategies specific to parallel running. Define monitoring requirements during migration that compare old and new system performance. Establish a command structure for the migration team. Document pre-migration validation steps. Create post-migration verification procedures.

Include Kustomize overlay configurations in the migration plan to support the parallel running approach across different environments. Implement base configurations for operators with environment-specific overlays for dev/staging/prod that control resource limits, replica counts, and storage classes. This approach will facilitate consistent deployment patterns while allowing environment-specific tuning during the migration process. Document how these Kustomize overlays should be structured to support the gradual traffic shifting strategy and ensure proper resource allocation during each phase of the migration.

# Test Strategy:
Review the parallel running plan with technical stakeholders. Conduct a tabletop exercise to validate traffic shifting procedures. Test rollback procedures at each stage in a staging environment. Verify monitoring captures necessary comparative data between old and new systems for decision making. Validate that the communication plan reaches all stakeholders during each phase of the transition. Test the command structure with a simulated issue during partial traffic routing. Verify that both systems can run simultaneously without interference.
