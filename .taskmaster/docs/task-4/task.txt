# Task ID: 4
# Title: Update Platform CRDs for Tool Specifications
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify CodeRun and DocsRun Custom Resource Definitions to accept tool specifications with local and remote tool lists
# Details:
Update CRD schemas to include tools field:
```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: coderuns.platform.5dlabs.com
spec:
  # ... existing spec ...
  versions:
  - name: v1
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        properties:
          spec:
            properties:
              # ... existing properties ...
              tools:
                type: object
                description: "Tool configuration for this run"
                properties:
                  local:
                    type: array
                    description: "Local MCP tools to enable"
                    items:
                      type: string
                      enum: ["filesystem", "git"]
                  remote:
                    type: array
                    description: "Remote MCP tools via toolman"
                    items:
                      type: string
```

Similar update for DocsRun CRD. Note: The enum for local tools is acceptable since these are built into the platform, but remote tools should NOT have an enum as they're dynamic

## Completion Summary:
- ✅ Updated CodeRun CRD: Replaced localTools/remoteTools string fields with structured tools object
- ✅ Updated DocsRun CRD: Added tools field with same structure
- ✅ Applied both CRDs to cluster successfully
- ✅ Tested validation: Enum correctly rejects invalid local tools
- ✅ Remote tools have no enum constraint as they are dynamically discovered

# Test Strategy:
Apply updated CRDs to cluster. Create test CodeRun/DocsRun resources with tool specifications. Verify kubectl accepts the new fields and validation works correctly
