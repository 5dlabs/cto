# Task ID: 1
# Title: Configure Argo CD Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Troubleshoot and fix existing Argo CD applications in the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring all applications are properly synced and healthy.
# Details:
Investigate and resolve sync issues for all 14 existing Argo CD applications, with special focus on applications currently showing OutOfSync status (arc) or Unknown status (k8s-mcp, rustdocs-mcp, twingate-pastoral, twingate-therapeutic). Verify application manifests against actual deployed resources. Check for configuration drift and correct as needed. Ensure proper connectivity between Argo CD and Git repositories. Validate resource definitions and fix any invalid Kubernetes objects. Update application health check configurations if needed. Document any recurring issues and their resolutions for future reference.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all 14 applications show Synced status in Argo CD UI. Confirm all applications report Healthy status. Validate that resources match the desired state in Git. Test manual sync operations to ensure they complete successfully. Document any applications requiring special handling or custom health checks.
