# Task ID: 15
# Title: Set Up Monitoring and Observability for Argo Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure metrics collection, dashboards, and alerting for Argo CD and Argo Workflows to ensure operational visibility.
# Details:
Configure Prometheus metrics collection for Argo CD and Argo Workflows. Create Grafana dashboards for deployment status, sync results, and workflow execution metrics. Set up alerting rules for failed syncs, stuck workflows, and resource constraints. Implement logging with structured formats. Configure log aggregation with appropriate retention policies. Create runbooks for common operational issues. Set up health checks for Argo components. Implement SLO/SLI monitoring for critical paths. Add tracing for complex operations using OpenTelemetry.

# Test Strategy:
Verify metrics are being collected correctly. Test dashboard visualizations with real data. Trigger test alerts to verify notification channels. Validate log collection and search functionality. Test runbooks against simulated failures. Verify health checks accurately reflect component status. Test tracing to ensure spans are properly created and collected.
