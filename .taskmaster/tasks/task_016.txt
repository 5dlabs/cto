# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Parallel Running of Old and New Systems
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up the infrastructure to run both the old Rust API and the new Argo Workflows-based system in parallel during the migration period, maintaining both systems until thorough validation is complete.
# Details:
Configure the MCP server to support both old and new job submission methods simultaneously. Implement a feature flag system to control which path is used. Create a migration strategy with percentage-based traffic splitting. Set up comprehensive monitoring to compare performance and reliability between systems. Implement detailed logging to track which system handled each job. Create a robust rollback mechanism in case of issues. Define clear metrics to evaluate migration success. Develop a communication plan for users during the migration. Maintain the old Rust API/CLI system as a reference implementation and fallback option. Only schedule removal of the old system after thorough validation of the new system's functionality, performance, and reliability. Document the criteria that must be met before the old system can be decommissioned.

# Test Strategy:
Test job submission through both old and new paths to ensure both remain fully functional. Verify feature flags correctly control routing between systems. Validate monitoring captures comprehensive data from both systems for comparison. Test the rollback mechanism to ensure it works correctly in various failure scenarios. Verify logs clearly indicate which system processed each job. Test gradual traffic shifting to ensure smooth transition. Create test cases that verify identical behavior between old and new systems for all supported job types. Implement comparison testing to validate that results from both systems match for equivalent inputs.
