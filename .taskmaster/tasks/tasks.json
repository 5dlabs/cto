This is preventing the GitHub Actions runner controller from being deployed properly.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to add cert-manager.io resources to the platform project whitelist in Argo CD. This will allow the application to create the necessary Certificate and Issuer resources required for proper functioning.\n\nThe specific resources that need to be added to the whitelist are:\n- cert-manager.io/Certificate\n- cert-manager.io/Issuer\n\nOnce these resources are added to the platform project's allowed resource types, we should be able to sync the arc application successfully and restore the GitHub Actions runner controller functionality.\n</info added on 2025-08-02T17:47:31.957Z>",
