This is preventing the GitHub Actions runner controller from being deployed properly.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to add cert-manager.io resources to the platform project whitelist in Argo CD.

        "details": "1. For each required operator (TwinGate, PostgreSQL, Redis, QuestDB, MinIO), review the official documentation (cloned in docs/) to determine production-ready configuration, high availability options, and required CRDs.\n2. Create a dedicated namespace for each operator, unless operator best practices recommend shared or global installation. Define namespace manifests in infra/gitops/operators/.\n3. Define Argo CD Application manifests for each operator in infra/gitops/operators/, specifying source repo, path, target namespace, and automated sync policies. Use sync waves (via argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave annotation) to ensure correct installation order (e.g., CRDs before operator controllers, then custom resources) [1][3].\n4. Configure RBAC (Roles, RoleBindings, ServiceAccounts) for each operator, granting only the minimum required permissions per documentation. Include OperatorGroup and Subscription manifests if using OLM [1].\n5. Set resource requests and limits for operator deployments to ensure cluster stability. Use production-appropriate values based on operator documentation and expected workload.\n6. Enable high availability for operators that support it (e.g., multiple replicas, leader election) and configure persistent storage where required.\n7. Integrate monitoring and health checks: add Prometheus ServiceMonitors or PodMonitors if supported, and configure Argo CD health checks for each operator [2].\n8. Reference the operator documentation in docs/ for any operator-specific configuration, secrets, or CRDs needed for initial setup.\n9. Commit all manifests to Git and ensure they are tracked by Argo CD for continuous reconciliation.\n10. Document any manual steps or prerequisites in the repo README for future maintainers.",

        "description": "Create an Argo Workflow to replace the GitHub Actions intake workflow, handling project initialization with support for webhook triggers and integration with existing agent workflows.",
        "details": "1. Analyze the existing GitHub Actions intake workflow (.github/workflows/intake.yml) to identify all functionality that needs to be migrated:\n   - Project parameter handling (name, description, type)\n   - TaskMaster initialization steps\n   - PRD parsing and processing\n   - File operations for PRD/architecture files\n\n2. Create a new WorkflowTemplate YAML in `infra/workflows/intake-workflow-template.yaml` with the following components:\n   - Define input parameters (project name, description, type)\n   - Configure persistent volume claims for workspace operations\n   - Set appropriate timeouts to avoid the current GitHub Actions timeout issues\n   - Implement steps for TaskMaster initialization\n   - Add steps for PRD parsing and processing\n   - Configure file operations within the workflow\n\n3. Implement the workflow steps:\n   ```yaml\n   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\n   kind: WorkflowTemplate\n   metadata:\n     name: project-intake\n     namespace: workflows\n   spec:\n     entrypoint: intake-main\n     arguments:\n       parameters:\n       - name: project-name\n         description: \"Name of the project\"\n       - name: project-description\n         description: \"Description of the project\"\n       - name: project-type\n         description: \"Type of project\"\n     volumeClaimTemplates:\n     - metadata:\n         name: workspace-pvc\n       spec:\n         accessModes: [\"ReadWriteOnce\"]\n         resources:\n           requests:\n             storage: 1Gi\n     templates:\n     - name: intake-main\n       steps:\n       - - name: initialize-taskmaster\n           template: initialize-taskmaster\n       - - name: parse-prd\n           template: parse-prd\n       - - name: process-files\n           template: process-files\n       - - name: trigger-agent-workflows\n           template: trigger-agent-workflows\n     # Define individual step templates below\n   ```\n\n4. Evaluate whether to create a new CRD (IntakeRun) or use parameterized WorkflowTemplates directly:\n   - For initial implementation, use parameterized WorkflowTemplates for simplicity\n   - Document considerations for future CRD implementation if needed\n\n5. Configure integration with existing DocsRun/CodeRun workflows:\n   - Add steps to trigger these workflows after intake completion\n   - Pass necessary parameters between workflows\n   - Ensure proper sequencing of workflow execution\n\n6. Implement Argo Events configuration to trigger the workflow:\n   - Create an EventSource for GitHub webhooks in `infra/events/github-eventsource.yaml`\n   - Create a Sensor in `infra/events/intake-sensor.yaml` to trigger the workflow\n   - Configure filters to only trigger on relevant GitHub events\n\n7. Add proper error handling and notification mechanisms:\n   - Configure retry policies for transient failures\n   - Implement notification steps for workflow completion or failure\n   - Add appropriate logging for debugging\n\n8. Update documentation to reflect the new intake process:\n   - Update developer guides\n   - Document API endpoints for manual triggering\n   - Create examples of webhook payloads\n<info added on 2025-08-02T17:45:33.486Z>\n9. Implementation Decision: The team has confirmed to use the WorkflowTemplate approach rather than creating a new IntakeRun CRD. This decision:\n   - Simplifies implementation by leveraging existing Argo Workflows functionality\n   - Avoids the need for custom controller modifications\n   - Provides a more straightforward path to production\n   - Maintains flexibility for future enhancements\n\n10. Workflow Trigger Mechanisms:\n   - Primary: Argo Events webhook triggers from GitHub events\n   - Secondary: Direct API calls for manual or programmatic triggering\n   - Both methods will accept the same project parameters (name, description, type)\n\n11. End-to-End Orchestration Responsibility:\n   - The intake workflow will handle the complete project initialization process\n   - Orchestrate TaskMaster initialization and configuration\n   - Manage PRD parsing and initial file generation\n   - Trigger subsequent DocsRun/CodeRun workflows with appropriate parameters\n   - Ensure proper handoff between workflow stages\n</info added on 2025-08-02T17:45:33.486Z>",

Verify the workflow template can be successfully applied to the Argo Workflows system:\n   ```bash\n   kubectl apply -f infra/workflows/intake-workflow-template.yaml\n   ```\n\n2.

Verify each step of the workflow executes correctly:\n   - Monitor the workflow execution using `argo watch`\n   - Check logs for each step to ensure proper execution\n   - Verify TaskMaster initialization completes successfully\n   - Confirm PRD parsing produces expected outputs\n   - Validate file operations work correctly\n\n4. Test webhook-triggered execution:\n   - Send a test webhook payload to the EventSource endpoint\n   - Verify the Sensor correctly triggers the workflow\n   - Confirm parameters are properly extracted from the webhook payload\n\n5. Test integration with DocsRun/CodeRun workflows:\n   - Verify these workflows are triggered after intake completion\n   - Confirm parameters are correctly passed between workflows\n   - Check for proper sequencing of workflow execution\n\n6. Perform error handling tests:\n   - Introduce intentional failures to test retry mechanisms\n   - Verify notifications are sent on workflow completion/failure\n   - Check that logs contain sufficient information for debugging\n\n7. Compare with GitHub Actions workflow:\n   - Create a test project using both the old and new methods\n   - Verify feature parity between the two approaches\n   - Confirm the new workflow resolves timeout issues\n\n8. Conduct end-to-end testing:\n   - Create a new project through the entire intake process\n   - Verify all artifacts are correctly generated\n   - Confirm the project is properly initialized in the system",
