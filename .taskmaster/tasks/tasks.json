        "details": "This task involves enhancing the documentation generation pipeline to produce tailored Toolman configurations for each task. The implementation should follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a new Handlebars template to render the toolman catalog data into markdown format for inclusion in the docs agent's prompt.\n\n2. Update the orchestrator deployment configuration to mount the `toolman-tool-catalog` ConfigMap, making the complete tool catalog available to the orchestration system.\n\n3. Modify the documentation generation process to:\n   - Read and parse the mounted tool catalog\n   - Render the toolman catalog data into markdown format using the template\n   - Embed this rendered markdown into the docs agent's prompt.md file\n   - Instruct the docs agent to generate a `toolman-config.json` file based on the catalog information in its prompt\n   - Ensure the docs agent selects appropriate tools based on task implementation needs\n   - Generate configurations with only specific tool selections (no wildcards)\n   - Include complete server configuration details for local servers\n\n4. Ensure the generated configuration files are placed at `.taskmaster/docs/task-{id}/toolman-config.json` for each task.\n\n5. Provide clear instructions in the docs agent prompt for analyzing task requirements and selecting appropriate tools from the catalog information embedded in the prompt.\n\n6. Update the docs agent interface to provide a clean catalog view that reduces cognitive load while ensuring access to the complete tool ecosystem.\n\nThe implementation should focus on maintainability and extensibility, allowing for easy updates to the tool selection logic as new tools are added to the catalog or as task requirements evolve.",
        "testStrategy": "To verify the correct implementation of task-specific Toolman configuration generation:\n\n1. Unit Tests:\n   - Create tests for the markdown template rendering logic using sample catalog data\n   - Verify that the embedded catalog information in the prompt is correctly formatted\n   - Test edge cases such as tasks with minimal or extensive tool requirements\n\n2. Integration Tests:\n   - Run a complete documentation generation job with multiple tasks of different types\n   - Verify that `.taskmaster/docs/task-{id}/toolman-config.json` files are generated for each task\n   - Validate the structure of generated files against the expected schema\n   - Confirm that server configurations for local tools are complete and correct\n   - Verify that the catalog information is correctly embedded in the docs agent's prompt\n\n3. Validation Tests:\n   - Load the generated configurations into a Toolman client\n   - Verify that the client can successfully connect to and use the specified tools\n   - Check that the tool selection is appropriate for the corresponding task requirements\n\n4. Manual Review:\n   - Inspect a sample of generated configurations to ensure they follow the format in `toolman-example-config.json`\n   - Verify that no wildcard selections are used, only specific tool selections\n   - Confirm that the cognitive load on the docs agent is reduced while maintaining access to necessary tools\n   - Review the embedded catalog information in the prompt for clarity and usability\n\n5. Performance Testing:\n   - Measure the impact on documentation generation time\n   - Ensure the configuration generation process scales efficiently with a large number of tasks",
