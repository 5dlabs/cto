# Task ID: 21
# Title: Evaluate and Migrate from Handlebars to Kubernetes-Native Templating
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 11, 12
# Priority: low
# Description: Research and compare Handlebars templates with Kubernetes-native templating solutions like Kustomize, Argo Workflows parameters, and Helm, then create a recommendation document and implementation plan for potential migration.
# Details:
1. Conduct a comprehensive analysis of current Handlebars template usage:
   - Inventory all Handlebars templates in the codebase
   - Document template complexity, usage patterns, and custom helpers
   - Identify integration points with existing systems

2. Research and evaluate Kubernetes-native templating alternatives:
   - Kustomize: Analyze overlay-based approach and integration with kubectl
   - Helm: Evaluate chart-based templating, functions, and package management
   - Argo Workflows parameters: Assess parameter substitution capabilities
   - Jsonnet/Tanka: Consider data templating approach and expressiveness
   - Ytt (YAML Templating Tool): Evaluate its YAML-aware templating features

3. Create comparison matrix with the following criteria:
   - Feature parity with current Handlebars implementation
   - Learning curve and developer experience
   - Integration with Argo CD and Argo Workflows
   - Performance and resource utilization
   - Community support and long-term viability
   - Testing and validation capabilities
   - Security considerations

4. Develop proof-of-concept implementations:
   - Convert 2-3 representative Handlebars templates to each alternative
   - Test functionality and performance
   - Document challenges and workarounds

5. Create a detailed recommendation document:
   - Executive summary with clear recommendation
   - Comparison results with pros/cons of each approach
   - Cost-benefit analysis of migration
   - Risk assessment

6. If migration is recommended, develop an implementation plan:
   - Phased migration approach with timeline
   - Required changes to CI/CD pipelines
   - Developer training requirements
   - Testing strategy for template equivalence
   - Rollback procedures
   - Success metrics

7. Consider hybrid approaches if appropriate:
   - Evaluate using different templating solutions for different use cases
   - Assess feasibility of gradual migration vs. complete replacement

8. Document integration patterns with Argo CD and Argo Workflows:
   - Best practices for template parameter passing
   - Version control and change management
   - Template validation in CI pipeline

# Test Strategy:
1. Functional equivalence testing:
   - Create test suite that compares rendered output from Handlebars templates with output from new templating solution
   - Verify identical functionality across a range of inputs and edge cases
   - Test with actual production data samples

2. Performance testing:
   - Measure template rendering time for both current and proposed solutions
   - Test with varying template complexity and data sizes
   - Evaluate memory usage during rendering

3. Integration testing:
   - Verify correct integration with Argo CD deployment processes
   - Test parameter passing from Argo Workflows
   - Validate GitOps workflow with new templating solution

4. Developer experience evaluation:
   - Conduct structured feedback sessions with developers
   - Measure time required to make common template changes
   - Assess debugging capabilities and error messages

5. Security assessment:
   - Review templating solution for potential security issues
   - Verify proper handling of sensitive data
   - Test input validation and escaping mechanisms

6. CI/CD pipeline validation:
   - Verify template validation in CI pipeline
   - Test deployment processes with new templating
   - Validate rollback procedures

7. Documentation review:
   - Ensure comprehensive documentation of new templating approach
   - Verify examples cover common use cases
   - Validate troubleshooting guides

8. Conduct pilot deployment:
   - Implement new templating in non-critical environment
   - Monitor for issues over 1-2 week period
   - Collect metrics on maintenance requirements
