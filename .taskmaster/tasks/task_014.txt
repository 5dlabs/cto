# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement MCP Server Integration with Workflow Templates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the MCP server to submit CodeRun and DocsRun jobs using the created Argo Workflow templates.
# Details:
Modify the MCP server job submission logic to use the Argo Workflows API client. Implement parameter mapping from job requests to workflow parameters. Create helper functions to generate workflow names and labels. Add validation for job inputs before submission. Implement error handling for submission failures. Add metrics collection for job submissions. Create a job ID to workflow name mapping mechanism. Implement retry logic for transient failures. Add logging for debugging and audit purposes.

# Test Strategy:
Submit test jobs through the MCP server. Verify parameters are correctly passed to workflows. Test error handling with invalid inputs. Validate metrics collection. Test retry logic with simulated failures. Verify logs contain necessary information for debugging. Test performance under load to ensure scalability.
