			"taskTitle": "Analyze Existing CodeRun Controller Architecture",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the comprehensive analysis of the CodeRun controller into distinct research areas: 1) Map the CRD processing flow from submission to pod creation in controller/src/tasks/code/ 2) Document Handlebars template system in templates.rs including context structure and rendering pipeline 3) Analyze PVC creation logic in resources.rs focusing on workspace naming conventions 4) Trace GitHub App authentication flow through External Secrets integration 5) Document Job/Pod lifecycle management and status updates 6) Map reconciliation loop with finalizer patterns 7) Create architecture diagrams showing component interactions 8) Document compatibility requirements with existing Rex/Blaze workflows",
