			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Structure and Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup into: (1) Initialize project and version control, (2) Install core dependencies, (3) Install dev dependencies, (4) Create base directory structure, (5) Add configuration files (.env, .gitignore, .dockerignore), (6) Configure package.json scripts, (7) Verify initial setup with test run.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational but follows standard, well-documented patterns for Node.js/Express.js projects. Each step is straightforward but should be separated for clarity, reproducibility, and to support best practices in modular project setup and onboarding[1][2][3][4]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Application Structure",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Implement Express app initialization, (2) Add and configure middleware (helmet, cors, pino, JSON body parser), (3) Implement correlation ID middleware, (4) Set up routing entry point, (5) Implement error and 404 handling middleware, (6) Create standardized response utilities.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple architectural concerns—middleware, error handling, and modularization—which are critical for maintainability and reliability. Each concern should be implemented and tested separately to align with industry best practices for Express.js applications[1][2][3][4]."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement API Endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Set up route index and registration, (2) Implement /health endpoint, (3) Implement /hello endpoint, (4) Implement /hello/{name} with validation, (5) Implement /echo endpoint with validation, (6) Implement /info endpoint, (7) Add and verify JSDoc comments for Swagger.",
			"reasoning": "This task covers multiple endpoints, each with its own logic and validation requirements. Proper separation ensures testability, clarity, and easier future extension. Including documentation comments is essential for API maintainability and discoverability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement API Documentation with Swagger",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Create base OpenAPI YAML file, (2) Integrate Swagger UI and JSON endpoints in app, (3) Annotate all routes with JSDoc for Swagger, (4) Implement root redirect to /docs, (5) Validate and test documentation endpoints.",
			"reasoning": "While the integration is conceptually simple, ensuring comprehensive and accurate documentation, proper route annotation, and endpoint validation requires attention to detail and systematic verification."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Testing Suite",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Configure Jest and coverage thresholds, (2) Write unit tests for utilities, (3) Write integration tests for endpoints, (4) Implement load testing script, (5) Integrate tests into CI pipeline, (6) Monitor and enforce coverage and performance thresholds.",
			"reasoning": "Achieving high coverage and robust testing across unit, integration, and load levels is complex and critical for quality. Each type of test and configuration should be handled as a distinct subtask to ensure thoroughness and maintainability."

			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Dockerfile with Multi-Stage Build",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Create .dockerignore, (2) Author multi-stage Dockerfile, (3) Add healthcheck and non-root user, (4) Write build/run verification script, (5) Test image size and container behavior.",
			"reasoning": "Containerization with multi-stage builds is a well-established pattern, but attention to security, image size, and runtime verification is necessary. Each step should be explicit to ensure best practices are followed."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create Kubernetes Deployment Manifests",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Write deployment.yaml, (2) Write service.yaml, (3) Write ingress.yaml, (4) Write configmap.yaml, (5) Author deployment script, (6) Test and validate manifests in a cluster.",
			"reasoning": "Kubernetes deployment involves multiple interdependent resources and validation steps. Each manifest and the deployment process should be handled separately to ensure correctness and ease of troubleshooting."

		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Create CI/CD Pipeline Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Author CI workflow for linting/testing, (2) Add build and Docker image push steps, (3) Integrate image size check, (4) Add deployment to Kubernetes, (5) Write and verify README documentation, (6) Test pipeline with various scenarios (fail/pass/build/deploy).",
			"reasoning": "A robust CI/CD pipeline integrates multiple stages and external systems (GitHub Actions, DockerHub, Kubernetes). Each stage should be a subtask to ensure atomicity, traceability, and maintainability, following industry standards for DevOps workflows."
