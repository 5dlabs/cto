			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Argo CD infrastructure setup into: (1) Helm chart installation, (2) RBAC configuration, (3) TLS and authentication setup, (4) resource requests/limits configuration, (5) directory structure creation for manifests, (6) GitHub webhook integration, (7) network policy implementation, and (8) validation/testing steps.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple critical aspects of Argo CD setup—secure installation, RBAC, network policies, GitOps directory structure, and integration with external systems. Each area requires specialized knowledge and careful sequencing to meet best practices for security, scalability, and maintainability[1][3]."

			"taskTitle": "Configure Argo Workflows Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task into: (1) Helm chart installation, (2) service account and RBAC setup, (3) persistent volume claim configuration, (4) resource quotas and limits, (5) workflow controller configuration, (6) directory structure for workflow templates, and (7) Prometheus metrics integration.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up Argo Workflows infrastructure requires orchestrating several Kubernetes primitives (RBAC, PVCs, quotas), controller configuration, and observability integration, each of which is a significant operational concern and must be validated independently."

			"taskTitle": "Set Up Monitoring and Observability for Argo Components",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Prometheus metrics setup for Argo CD, (2) Prometheus metrics setup for Argo Workflows, (3) Grafana dashboard creation, (4) alerting rule configuration, (5) structured logging implementation, (6) log aggregation and retention, (7) runbook and health check creation, and (8) SLO/SLI and tracing setup.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive observability spans metrics, dashboards, alerting, logging, and runbooks, each with distinct tooling and validation requirements. Industry standards recommend modularizing these for maintainability and incident response."

			"taskTitle": "Create CodeRun Workflow Template",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: (1) workflow step definition, (2) resource and environment variable configuration, (3) volume mount and PVC setup, (4) monitoring labels/annotations, (5) timeout/retry/artifact handling, and (6) parameterization and secret management.",
			"reasoning": "Designing a reusable workflow template involves several discrete concerns—step logic, resource management, security, and observability—each requiring careful YAML authoring and validation."

			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) workflow step definition, (2) resource and environment variable configuration, (3) volume mount and PVC setup, (4) monitoring labels/annotations, (5) timeout/retry/artifact handling, and (6) parameterization and secret management.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to the CodeRun template, this task requires modular handling of workflow logic, resource allocation, and security, following best practices for maintainable and auditable workflow definitions."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) client module scaffolding, (2) authentication implementation, (3) workflow submission methods, (4) status monitoring functions, (5) log retrieval, (6) error handling and retries, and (7) configuration structure and circuit breaker integration.",
			"reasoning": "Developing a robust API client involves not only CRUD operations but also authentication, error handling, resilience patterns, and configuration—all of which are critical for production-grade integrations."

			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Create Argo CD Application Manifests",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) manifest authoring for each service, (2) sync policy configuration, (3) health check setup, (4) resource exclusion and annotation, (5) retry and tracking configuration, (6) namespace scoping, and (7) documentation of conventions.",
			"reasoning": "Converting Helm deployments to Argo CD manifests requires careful mapping of deployment logic, sync policies, health checks, and documentation, following GitOps best practices for traceability and automation[1]."

			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) status monitoring service implementation, (2) Kubernetes watch API integration, (3) caching layer development, (4) log streaming, (5) metrics collection, (6) status mapping and notification, and (7) error handling for failures.",
			"reasoning": "Effective workflow monitoring requires real-time status tracking, efficient resource usage, log management, and robust error handling, each of which is a distinct engineering concern."

			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) handler file deletion, (2) utility and middleware removal, (3) reusable logic identification, (4) logic refactoring/migration, (5) import and reference updates, and (6) test cleanup and updates.",
			"reasoning": "Removing a code layer with reusable logic requires careful extraction, refactoring, and validation to avoid regressions, following standard refactoring and code hygiene practices."
