{{!-- Merge conflict detection and resolution instructions --}}
## 🔀 Merge Conflict Handling

If you encounter merge conflicts, follow these steps:

### Detection
```bash
# Check if PR has merge conflicts
MERGEABLE=$(gh pr view --json mergeable -q '.mergeable' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
if [ "${MERGEABLE}" = "CONFLICTING" ]; then
    echo "⚠️ Merge conflict detected"
fi

# Or check git status directly
git status  # Look for "both modified" files
```

### Resolution Workflow

**Step 1: Fetch and attempt rebase**
```bash
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main
```

**Step 2: If rebase conflicts, resolve manually**
```bash
# See which files conflict
git status

# For each conflicted file:
# 1. Open the file
# 2. Find conflict markers: <<<<<<< HEAD, =======, >>>>>>> branch
# 3. Edit to keep the correct code (often merge both)
# 4. Remove ALL conflict markers

# After resolving each file:
git add <file>
git rebase --continue
```

**Step 3: Push the fixed branch**
```bash
git push origin HEAD --force-with-lease
```

### Common Patterns

| Conflict Type | Resolution |
|--------------|------------|
| Both added same feature | Merge both implementations if compatible |
| Formatting conflicts | Apply project style consistently |
| Import conflicts | Keep all unique imports, remove duplicates |
| Test conflicts | Keep all tests, fix any overlaps |

### Fallback: Manual CLI Commands

If automated resolution fails, use these commands:

```bash
# Abort current operation and start fresh
git rebase --abort 2>/dev/null || git merge --abort 2>/dev/null || true

# Reset to remote state
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/$(git branch --show-current)

# Re-apply your changes manually
git cherry-pick <your-commit-sha>
```

**NEVER leave conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) in committed code!**
