# Acceptance Criteria: Publishing & Deployment

## Prerequisites (MUST be completed FIRST)

### ✅ All PRs Merged
- [ ] All task PRs reviewed and approved
- [ ] All PRs merged to main branch
- [ ] No open PRs remaining for this project
- [ ] Main branch contains all changes
- [ ] No merge conflicts exist

## Deployment Requirements

### ✅ Docker Image
- [ ] Dockerfile exists and is valid
- [ ] Image builds successfully from main branch
- [ ] Image tagged with version (e.g., v1.0.0)
- [ ] Image pushed to container registry (ghcr.io)
- [ ] Image pull successful from registry

### ✅ Kubernetes Manifests
- [ ] Deployment manifest created
- [ ] Service manifest created
- [ ] Ingress manifest created (Ngrok)
- [ ] Secrets/ConfigMaps configured (if needed)
- [ ] Resource limits defined
- [ ] Health/readiness probes configured

### ✅ Deployment Health
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment applied successfully
- [ ] All pods running (e.g., 2/2 ready)
- [ ] No CrashLoopBackOff or errors
- [ ] Health endpoint responds 200 OK
- [ ] Readiness probe passing
- [ ] Logs show no critical errors

### ✅ Ngrok Ingress
- [ ] Ngrok ingress resource created
- [ ] Ingress shows ready status
- [ ] Public URL obtained (e.g., https://xyz.ngrok.app)
- [ ] URL is accessible externally
- [ ] DNS resolves correctly
- [ ] HTTPS certificate valid

### ✅ Functional Validation
- [ ] Health endpoint accessible via public URL
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Authentication works (if applicable)
- [ ] Database connectivity verified (if applicable)
- [ ] Key user flows functional

### ✅ Documentation
- [ ] Deployment report created
- [ ] Public URLs documented
- [ ] Access instructions provided
- [ ] Environment configuration documented
- [ ] Known issues/limitations noted (if any)

## Critical Path

```
1. MERGE ALL PRS → 2. Build Image → 3. Deploy K8s → 4. Setup Ngrok → 5. Verify Access → 6. Document URLs
```

**Step 1 (Merge PRs) is MANDATORY and BLOCKING for all other steps!**

## Expected Outputs

1. **Public URL**: https://<service>.ngrok.app
2. **Deployment Status**: Healthy, X/X pods running
3. **Test Results**: All smoke tests passing
4. **Documentation**: Deployment report with access URLs

## Failure Conditions

- ❌ Any PRs remain unmerged
- ❌ Deployment pods not healthy
- ❌ Ngrok URL not accessible
- ❌ Health endpoint returning errors
- ❌ Critical functionality broken

## Success Definition

Task is complete when:
- All PRs merged to main ✅
- Application deployed and healthy ✅
- Ngrok ingress configured ✅
- Public URL accessible and tested ✅
- Deployment report created with URLs ✅
