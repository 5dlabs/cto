# Task: Integration Validation - Level LEVEL_INDEX

## Overview
This is an **integration task** that validates all tasks from execution level LEVEL_INDEX work together correctly before proceeding to the next level.

## Context
When multiple tasks run in parallel (within the same execution level), they may integrate in unexpected ways even if they don't have direct dependencies. This task ensures:
- Code from all level LEVEL_INDEX tasks integrates without conflicts
- Components work together as a cohesive system
- No breaking changes introduced
- System remains stable after integration

## Your Mission

### 1. Verify All PRs Merged
Ensure all task PRs from level LEVEL_INDEX have been merged to main branch.

### 2. Pull Integrated Code
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### 3. Run Complete Test Suite
Execute all tests with the integrated code:
```bash
# Run appropriate test commands for the project
npm test
cargo test  
pytest
# etc.
```

### 4. Check for Integration Issues

**Common problems to look for:**
- Merge conflicts (shouldn't exist, but verify)
- Runtime errors when components interact
- API contract mismatches between services
- Database migration order issues
- Configuration conflicts
- Resource naming collisions
- Test failures that only appear with integrated code

### 5. Validate Build
```bash
# Verify production build succeeds
npm run build
cargo build --release
# etc.
```

### 6. Integration Testing
If integration tests exist, run them:
```bash
npm run test:integration
cargo test --test integration
```

### 7. Document Findings
Create an integration report documenting:
- What was tested
- Any issues found
- How issues were resolved
- Current system status

## Deliverables

1. **Integration validation report** confirming all level LEVEL_INDEX tasks integrate correctly
2. **Fixes for any integration issues** (if discovered)
3. **Updated documentation** (if integration revealed gaps)

## Success Criteria

✅ All level LEVEL_INDEX task PRs merged to main  
✅ Full test suite passes on main branch  
✅ Production build succeeds  
✅ No integration conflicts or errors  
✅ Integration report created  
✅ System validated and ready for next execution level

## Agent Assignment
**Primary:** Tess (QA Agent)  
**Alternate:** Morgan (Docs Agent)  
**Rationale:** Integration validation requires comprehensive testing and validation capabilities.

## Estimated Effort
30-60 minutes (mostly automated testing)

## Priority
**High** - This is a gate between execution levels. Next level cannot start until integration is validated.
