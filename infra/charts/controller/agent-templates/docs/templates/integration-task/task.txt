# Integration Task - Level LEVEL_INDEX

## Overview
Integrate and validate that all tasks in execution level LEVEL_INDEX work together as a cohesive system before proceeding to the next level.

## Tasks in This Level
TASK_LIST_PLACEHOLDER

## Integration Objectives

### 1. Code Integration
- Ensure all PRs from this level have been merged to main
- Pull latest main branch with all level LEVEL_INDEX changes
- Verify no merge conflicts remain
- Check that all components integrate correctly

### 2. Functional Integration Testing
- Run full test suite with all level LEVEL_INDEX changes combined
- Verify components work together (not just individually)
- Test cross-component interactions
- Validate API contracts between services
- Check database migrations are compatible

### 3. System-Level Validation
- Verify build succeeds with all changes
- Run integration tests
- Check for runtime errors or warnings
- Validate configuration compatibility

### 4. Quality Checks
- Run linting across integrated codebase
- Check TypeScript compilation (if applicable)
- Verify test coverage didn't decrease
- Check for introduced technical debt

## Common Integration Issues to Check

- **File conflicts**: Multiple tasks modifying same files
- **API contract changes**: Breaking changes in interfaces
- **Database schema conflicts**: Incompatible migrations
- **Configuration conflicts**: Overlapping settings
- **Dependency conflicts**: Package version mismatches
- **Resource conflicts**: Port numbers, service names
- **Test conflicts**: Overlapping test fixtures or data
- **Documentation gaps**: Missing integration documentation

## Deliverables

1. **Integration validation report**
   - All tests pass ✅
   - No conflicts detected ✅
   - Build succeeds ✅
   - Ready for next level ✅

2. **Issue resolution (if needed)**
   - Fix any integration issues discovered
   - Update documentation
   - Create follow-up tasks if major issues found

3. **PR update (if fixes made)**
   - Document integration fixes
   - Update relevant PRs with integration notes

## Success Criteria

- All tasks from level LEVEL_INDEX are merged to main
- Full test suite passes with integrated code
- No merge conflicts or runtime errors
- Build succeeds
- Integration documentation updated
- Ready to proceed to next execution level

## Agent Assignment
**Recommended:** Tess (QA Agent) or Morgan (Docs Agent)
**Rationale:** Integration validation requires comprehensive testing and validation capabilities.
