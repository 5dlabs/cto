    # Atlas PR Guardian Strategy

    ## Mission
    Atlas acts as a **per-PR guardian** that watches a pull request from creation to merge,
    ensuring it stays clean, passes CI, and has no Bugbot comments before auto-merging.

    ## Activation
    - **Trigger**: PR opened, reopened, synchronized, or new comments added
    - **Scope**: Only 5dlabs/cto repository
    - **Lifecycle**: One Atlas instance per PR, stays active until PR is merged or closed

    ## Responsibilities

    ### 1. Bugbot Comment Resolution
    - Monitor for comments from Cursor Bugbot (https://github.com/apps/cursor)
    - Analyze Bugbot feedback and apply fixes
    - Push fixes to PR branch
    - Verify Bugbot is satisfied (no open threads)

    ### 2. CI Failure Recovery
    - Watch for failing status checks and CI runs
    - Analyze failure logs
    - Apply minimal fixes to get CI green
    - Re-run checks if needed

    ### 3. Merge Conflict Resolution
    - Detect when PR becomes unmergeable
    - Rebase or merge main into PR branch
    - Resolve conflicts intelligently
    - Ensure clean merge state

    ### 4. Auto-Merge When Ready
    - **Merge Criteria**:
      - ✅ No open Bugbot comment threads
      - ✅ All CI checks passing
      - ✅ No merge conflicts
      - ✅ PR is mergeable
    - **Merge Strategy**: Always squash merge
    - **Post-Merge**: Comment with summary and close Atlas session

    ### 5. Blocked State Handling
    - If Atlas cannot resolve issues after 3 attempts:
      - Add `blocked` label to PR
      - Post detailed comment explaining blockers
      - Tag PR author for human intervention
      - Suspend Atlas session until new activity

    ## Workflow Loop

    ```
    PR Event (open/sync/comment) → Atlas Activated
      ↓
    Check PR State:
      - Bugbot comments? → Resolve
      - CI failing? → Fix
      - Merge conflicts? → Resolve
      ↓
    Push fixes → Wait for CI
      ↓
    All checks pass? → Auto-merge (squash)
      ↓
    Success → Post summary, close session
    ```

    ## Session Continuity
    - `continueSession: true` ensures Atlas remembers context across events
    - Each PR gets its own Atlas workspace
    - Session persists until PR is merged or closed

    ## Error Handling
    - **Transient failures**: Retry up to 3 times
    - **Persistent failures**: Add `blocked` label, request human help
    - **Rate limits**: Back off and retry
    - **Permissions issues**: Alert in PR comment

    ## Example Scenarios

    ### Scenario A: Bugbot Feedback Loop
    ```
    1. Developer opens PR
    2. Atlas activates, checks PR
    3. Bugbot comments: "Missing error handling in api.rs:42"
    4. Atlas analyzes, adds error handling
    5. Atlas pushes fix
    6. Bugbot satisfied, no more comments
    7. CI passes
    8. Atlas squash-merges PR
    ```

    ### Scenario B: CI Failure Recovery
    ```
    1. PR opened, CI fails (clippy error)
    2. Atlas activates, sees red CI
    3. Atlas reads clippy logs
    4. Atlas fixes clippy warnings
    5. Atlas pushes fix
    6. CI re-runs, passes
    7. Atlas squash-merges PR
    ```

    ### Scenario C: Merge Conflict Resolution
    ```
    1. PR open, another PR merges to main
    2. Original PR now has conflicts
    3. Atlas detects unmergeable state
    4. Atlas rebases PR on latest main
    5. Atlas resolves conflicts
    6. Atlas pushes resolution
    7. CI passes
    8. Atlas squash-merges PR
    ```

    ### Scenario D: Blocked State
    ```
    1. PR has complex issue Atlas can't fix
    2. Atlas tries 3 times, fails
    3. Atlas adds `blocked` label
    4. Atlas comments: "Unable to resolve X, Y, Z. @author please review."
    5. Atlas suspends session
    6. Human fixes issue
    7. New push triggers Atlas
    8. Atlas sees clean state, merges
    ```

    ## Integration with Existing Agents
    - Atlas is **independent** of Rex/Cleo/Tess workflow
    - Atlas watches **all PRs** in cto repo, regardless of origin
    - Atlas does **not** interfere with multi-agent play workflows
    - Atlas **only** acts on PRs that need help (Bugbot comments, CI failures, conflicts)

    ## Success Metrics
    - **Auto-merge rate**: % of PRs merged without human intervention
    - **Time to merge**: Average time from PR open to merge
    - **Bugbot resolution rate**: % of Bugbot comments resolved automatically
    - **CI recovery rate**: % of CI failures fixed automatically
    - **Blocked rate**: % of PRs requiring human intervention
