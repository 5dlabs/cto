# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement User Authentication with JWT
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Add user authentication using JSON Web Tokens for the backend.
# Details:
Create routes for user registration and login. Use bcrypt to hash passwords and jwt to issue tokens. Set up middleware to protect routes and decode JWT tokens.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration and login routes with valid and invalid credentials. Verify JWT token issuance and validate protected routes with token authentication.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Setup User Registration and Login Routes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create API routes for user registration and login.
### Details:
Implement POST routes for '/register' and '/login' in the Express application. Ensure that the routes handle JSON payloads and connect to the database.

## 2. Implement Password Hashing with bcrypt [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Use bcrypt to hash user passwords before storing them in the database.
### Details:
Integrate bcrypt in the user registration process to hash passwords securely. Ensure that the login process checks hashed passwords correctly.

## 3. Generate JWT Tokens for Authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Issue JWT tokens upon successful user login.
### Details:
Use the jwt library to generate tokens after user credentials are verified. Ensure tokens contain necessary user information for session management.

## 4. Set Up Authentication Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Create middleware to protect routes using JWT tokens.
### Details:
Develop middleware functions to decode and verify JWT tokens for authorization. Apply middleware to protect specific routes that require user authentication.

## 5. Test User Authentication Routes [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Verify the functionality of user registration, login, and protected routes.
### Details:
Perform tests with valid and invalid credentials to ensure proper registration and login. Check that JWT tokens are issued correctly and protected routes are accessible only with valid tokens.
