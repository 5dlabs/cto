# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Error Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Include comprehensive error handling in both frontend and backend.
# Details:
Implement global error handling middleware in Express. Use React error boundaries in the frontend.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate errors and ensure they are handled gracefully with appropriate messages.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Global Error Handling Middleware in Express [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a global error handling middleware function in the Express application to catch and process errors.
### Details:
Create a middleware function that catches errors and sends a structured error response. Ensure all routes are wrapped to use this middleware.

## 2. Test Express Error Handling Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Perform testing to ensure that the global error handling middleware in Express correctly handles errors.
### Details:
Simulate different types of errors within the Express application and verify that they are handled by the middleware. Check that appropriate error messages are logged and returned to the client.

## 3. Implement React Error Boundaries [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create error boundary components in React to catch errors in the component tree.
### Details:
Define error boundary components using React's componentDidCatch lifecycle method or the useErrorBoundary hook. Wrap critical components with these error boundaries.

## 4. Test React Error Boundaries [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Ensure that React error boundaries are working correctly by simulating component errors.
### Details:
Introduce deliberate errors in the React components to ensure that the error boundaries catch them and display fallback UIs. Confirm that the application does not crash.
