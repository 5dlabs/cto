# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Error Handling Strategy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add comprehensive error handling throughout the application.
# Details:
Implement error boundaries in React to catch rendering errors. Use Express error-handling middleware to manage server-side errors. Log errors for monitoring and debugging.

# Test Strategy:
Introduce deliberate errors in both frontend and backend to ensure they are caught and handled gracefully without crashing the application.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement React Error Boundaries [pending]
### Dependencies: None

## 2. Setup Express Error-Handling Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and integrate middleware in Express to handle server-side errors.

Develop a middleware function to catch errors in Express routes. Ensure the middleware logs errors and sends a user-friendly response to the client.

## 3. Implement Logging Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Establish logging for both frontend and backend to monitor and debug errors.
### Details:
Set up a logging framework to capture errors caught by React error boundaries and Express middleware. Ensure logs are stored in a centralized location for easy monitoring.
