# 5D Labs Platform Roadmap

The 5D Labs Platform is evolving to become the premier AI-driven development platform. This roadmap outlines our planned features and enhancements to deliver more powerful, intelligent, and cost-effective development workflows.

## ‚úÖ Recently Implemented

### GitHub Webhooks to Argo Workflows
- **Completed**: Public webhook entry via ngrok Gateway API
- **Completed**: Argo Events EventSource for GitHub integration  
- **Completed**: Event filtering and workflow triggering
- **Completed**: Support for issues, PRs, comments, and workflow events



## üöÄ In Progress - Q1 2025

### Agent-Centric Tool Configuration


**Transform tool configuration from task-driven to agent-driven model**


- Predefined tool sets per agent role (no more dynamic generation per task)


- Tool inheritance and composition for common patterns


- ~500-1000 token savings per task by eliminating generation overhead


- Tool usage analytics and optimization


- Dynamic tool augmentation for special cases

### Agent Persona Creator


**Automated AI agent creation with full GitHub App integration**


- Generate unique personas with personality traits and communication styles


- Automatic GitHub App creation via manifest API


- System prompt generation based on purpose and capabilities


- Kubernetes resource generation (ConfigMaps, Secrets)


- Avatar generation support (future enhancement)

## üîß Core Platform Enhancements - Q1-Q2 2025

### PR Comment Feedback Loop


**Recursive feedback system for continuous improvement**


- Rex responds to PR comments from Tess for remediation


- Structured comment format for actionable feedback


- Automatic workflow restart on required changes


- Iteration tracking with safety limits


- Human override capabilities via labels


- Silent fixes from Cleo (no comment-based feedback)


- Loop continues until Tess approves (120% satisfaction)

### Parallel Task Execution


**Intelligent parallel execution for independent tasks**


- Automatic detection of tasks without dependencies


- Safe parallelization rules based on bounded contexts


- Conflict detection for file/API/database overlaps


- Speculative execution with rollback capabilities


- Progressive parallelization based on conflict history


- Risk scoring system for parallelization decisions


- Support for explicit parallel/sequential task groups

### Multi-CLI Integration


**Support for diverse AI development tools**


- **Grok CLI** - X.AI's development assistant integration


- **Gemini CLI** - Google's Gemini model integration


- **All Hands CLI** - OpenHands development agent support


- Unified interface across different AI providers


- Consistent workflow regardless of underlying CLI

### GitHub Projects & Document Synchronization


**Bidirectional sync between text files and GitHub Issues**


- Text files remain source of truth for all task definitions


- GitHub Issues provide human interface for discussions and feedback


- Automatic issue body updates when documents change


- Morgan processes issue comments for document updates


- Custom fields for agent tracking and workflow stages


- Project board automation rules for status transitions


- Human-in-the-loop capabilities via issue comments

### Play Workflow Configuration Management


**Project-scoped configuration persistence**


- ConfigMap-based storage for project settings


- Consistent agent/model settings across all tasks


- Mid-project agent switching capabilities


- Configuration inheritance from previous tasks


- Fallback to defaults when ConfigMap is missing


- Support for multiple parallel projects


- Web UI for configuration management (future)

### XML/Markdown Format Selection


**Flexible documentation format support**


- Runtime format selection via MCP parameters


- Support for both XML and Markdown formats


- Backward compatibility with Markdown as default


- Format-specific processing and validation


- Structured data advantages with XML


- A/B testing capabilities for format comparison


- Auto-format selection based on task complexity (future)

## üé≠ Agent Specialization - Q2 2025

### Agent Profiles


**Specialized agents for different domains**


- **DevOps Agent** - Kubernetes, Terraform, infrastructure tools


- **Rust Agent** - Rust-specific documentation and best practices


- **Frontend Agent** - React, TypeScript, modern web development


- **Security Agent** - Security scanning, compliance, vulnerability assessment


- **Data Agent** - Database design, ETL, analytics workflows

## üìä Intelligence & Optimization - Q2-Q3 2025

### Telemetry-Driven Context Optimization


**Smart context management and cost optimization**


- Agent confusion detection via telemetry analysis


- Automated context injection when agents need more information


- Cost optimization through intelligent prompt management


- Accuracy improvements via contextual awareness


- Real-time agent performance monitoring

### AI Supervision & Guidance


**Intelligent agent oversight and course correction**


- Supervisory agent system that monitors primary code agents


- Automated detection of agent confusion or off-track behavior


- Context-aware feedback and guidance injection


- Multi-agent coordination for complex problem resolution


- Intelligent intervention to replace human oversight
