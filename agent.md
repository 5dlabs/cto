Session Summary: Orchestrator Clean Slate 
  Implementation & Debugging Setup

  üéØ Session Overview

  This session continued work from a previous
  conversation focused on implementing
  orchestrator code functionality with automatic
  PR creation. We performed a comprehensive clean
  slate setup to test the improved workflow with
  updated CRD fields and resolved multiple
  technical issues.

  ‚úÖ Major Accomplishments

  1. Model Bug Fix Verification

  - Issue: MODEL environment variable wasn't being
   passed through to Claude execution
  - Resolution: Confirmed the fix was working
  correctly - Claude now uses Sonnet 4 as
  specified
  - Status: ‚úÖ Verified working

  2. CRD Field Renaming (platform ‚Üí docs)**

  - Changes Made:
    - platformRepositoryUrl ‚Üí docsRepositoryUrl
    - platformProjectDirectory ‚Üí
  docsProjectDirectory
    - Added docsBranch field
  - Files Updated:
    - /Users/jonathonfritz/platform/orchestrator/o
  rchestrator-core/src/crds/coderun.rs
    - /Users/jonathonfritz/platform/infra/charts/o
  rchestrator/templates/coderun-crd.yaml
    - CLI and handler files
  - Status: ‚úÖ Complete and deployed

  3. Container Script Improvements

  - Docs Repository Cleanup: Added automatic
  cleanup after copying tasks to prevent Claude
  confusion
  - Consistent Directory Naming: Maintained
  target-repo naming (not dynamic)
  - SSH-Only Authentication: Removed all GitHub
  token references
  - Git Configuration: Fixed persistence issues by
   using local config on PVC
  - Status: ‚úÖ Deployed and working

  4. Critical Infrastructure Fixes

  GitHub Actions Permissions

  - Issue: serviceaccounts "orchestrator" is 
  forbidden - missing permissions
  - Root Cause: GitHub runner's cluster role
  missing serviceaccounts permission
  - Fix: Added serviceaccounts to
  github-runner-deploy cluster role
  - Status: ‚úÖ Resolved

  Secret Management

  - Issue: API key and SSH secrets were
  missing/incorrect
  - Resolution:
    - Created proper claude-api-key secret from
  orchestrator-secrets
    - Copied ghcr-secret for container image pulls
    - Fixed SSH secret naming
  (github-ssh-pm0-5dlabs)
  - Status: ‚úÖ All secrets properly managed via
  Helm

  Git Configuration Persistence

  - Issue: Git config was being set in ephemeral
  filesystem (/root/.gitconfig)
  - Root Cause: Not persisting on PVC, causing
  "Author identity unknown" errors
  - Fix: Changed to git config --local in
  repository directories on PVC
  - Added: push.autoSetupRemote=true for automatic
   upstream setup
  - Status: ‚úÖ Git operations now work properly

  5. Hook System Improvements & Removal

  - Shell Compatibility: Fixed bash vs zsh issues
  in hook scripts
  - Process Substitution: Resolved exec > 
  >(tee...) syntax errors
  - Final Decision: Removed all hooks per user
  request
  - Settings Update: Disabled hooks in
  settings.json.hbs and set includeCoAuthoredBy: 
  false
  - Status: ‚úÖ Clean environment without hook
  interference

  6. Debug Environment Setup

  - Created: Debug pod with identical
  configuration to Claude container
  - Features:
    - Same user context (node user, uid 1000)
    - Same SSH key setup and git configuration
    - Same volume mounts (/workspace confirmed as
  PVC)
    - No repository cloning - just configuration
  setup
  - Purpose: Accurate testing environment for git
  operations
  - Status: ‚úÖ Ready for testing

  7. Repository Detection Logic

  - Confirmed: Container script already has smart
  repository detection
  - Docs Repo: Checks existence, updates if found,
   clones if missing
  - Target Repo: Sophisticated branch management
  with conflict resolution
  - Benefit: Preserves work, prevents unnecessary
  recloning
  - Status: ‚úÖ Already implemented and working

  üîß Technical Details

  Current Deployment State

  - Helm Revision: 13 (latest)
  - CodeRun: test-clean-pvc running successfully
  - Debug Pod: debug-pvc ready for testing
  - PVC: Fresh workspace (workspace-simple-api)
  - Environment: Clean slate with no hooks

  Key Configuration Changes

  # CRD Fields (updated)
  docsRepositoryUrl:
  "git@github.com:5dlabs/platform.git"
  docsProjectDirectory: "_projects/simple-api"
  docsBranch: "feature/example-project-and-cli"

  # Git Config (local, persistent)
  user.name: "pm0-5dlabs"
  user.email:
  "pm0-5dlabs@users.noreply.github.com"
  push.autoSetupRemote: true

  # Settings (hooks disabled)
  includeCoAuthoredBy: false
  # hooks section removed

  File Locations

  - Container Script:
  /Users/jonathonfritz/platform/infra/charts/orche
  strator/claude-templates/code/container.sh.hbs
  - Settings:
  /Users/jonathonfritz/platform/infra/charts/orche
  strator/claude-templates/code/settings.json.hbs
  - CRD: /Users/jonathonfritz/platform/infra/chart
  s/orchestrator/templates/coderun-crd.yaml
  - Debug Pod:
  /Users/jonathonfritz/platform/debug-pod.yaml

  üéØ Current Status & Next Steps

  Ready for Testing

  1. CodeRun Execution: test-clean-pvc completed
  with new workflow
  2. Git Operations: Can test push/pull in debug
  pod with identical config
  3. SSH Authentication: Working properly in both
  environments
  4. Repository State: Fresh PVC with Claude's
  implementation ready to examine

  Verification Needed

  - CLAUDE.md Pointers: Ready for examination in
  /workspace/target-repo/CLAUDE.md
  - Git Push: Upstream configuration and branch
  conflicts need resolution
  - PR Creation: Test workflow without hooks
  (manual PR creation)

  Environment Details

  - Namespace: orchestrator
  - PVC: workspace-simple-api (confirmed
  persistent)
  - Debug Access: kubectl exec debug-pvc -n 
  orchestrator -- bash
  - Working Directory: /workspace/target-repo

  üîç Outstanding Items

  1. Branch conflict resolution in git repository
  2. Manual PR creation testing
  3. CLAUDE.md content examination
  4. End-to-end workflow validation without hooks

  The environment is now in a clean, testable
  state with all major infrastructure issues
  resolved and configurations properly aligned
  between debug and execution environments.
