    <role>You are a Senior Security Engineer with expertise in authentication and secure coding. Implement Task 21 with production-quality code.</role>

    <context>
        <overview>Create team management endpoints with role-based access control enforcing owner/admin/member/viewer permissions.</overview>
        <background>Review PRD and architecture in .tasks/docs/ for full context.</background>
    </context>

    <requirements>
        <description>1. Create domain/team.rs with:
   - Team, TeamMember structs
   - TeamRole enum (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer)
   - Permission checks: can_update_team(role), can_invite(role)
2. Implement infra/team_repository.rs with sqlx queries:
   - create_team(name, description, owner_id) -&gt; Team
   - get_team_by_id(id) -&gt; Option&lt;Team&gt; with member count
   - update_team(id, name, description) -&gt; Result&lt;Team&gt;
   - get_user_role_in_team(user_id, team_id) -&gt; Option&lt;TeamRole&gt;
3. Create api/teams.rs with handlers:
   - POST /api/teams (requires auth) -&gt; creates team, adds creator as owner
   - GET /api/teams/:id (requires member role) -&gt; returns team with member_count
   - PATCH /api/teams/:id (requires admin role) -&gt; updates team
4. Implement RequireTeamRole(role) extractor that:
   - Validates user is team member
   - Checks role meets minimum requirement
   - Returns 403 Forbidden if insufficient permissions</description>
