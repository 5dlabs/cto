# Morph MCP Tools

This workspace has Morph MCP tools available for faster code operations.

## Available Tools

- `mcp_morph-mcp_edit_file` - Fast Apply code edits at 10,500+ tokens/sec with 98% accuracy
- `mcp_morph-mcp_warp_grep` - Intelligent code search, 20x faster than standard grep

## Usage Guidelines

### For Code Edits
ALWAYS prefer `mcp_morph-mcp_edit_file` over built-in edit tools when making code changes. It uses `// ... existing code ...` markers to show only changed lines, which is faster and more accurate.

### For Code Search  
Use `mcp_morph-mcp_warp_grep` FIRST when you need to understand code or find relevant context across files. It intelligently plans multiple searches and returns ranked results.

## Edit File Format

When using the edit_file tool, structure edits like:

```
// ... existing code ...
CHANGED_CODE_HERE
// ... existing code ...
```

The `instruction` parameter should be a first-person description of what you're changing.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **DON'T** read files before editing them - Morph's edit_file reads only what it needs
- **DON'T** manually chain grep/read cycles to explore code - use warp_grep instead
- **DON'T** load multiple files into context to understand architecture - use warp_grep
