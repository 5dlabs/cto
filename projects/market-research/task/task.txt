# Task 1: Research AI Development Tools Landscape

## Overview
Conduct comprehensive web research on current AI development tools and frameworks, with focus on code generation and developer productivity tools.

## Objective
Use remote MCP server (Brave Search) to gather market intelligence on AI development tools, then process and structure findings using local MCP capabilities.

## Requirements
- Remote MCP server for web research via Brave Search
- Local MCP server for file operations and report generation
- Research top 5-7 AI development tools in the market
- Document competitive landscape and key differentiators

## Acceptance Criteria
✓ Use Brave Search to find top 5-7 AI development tools
✓ Identify key features and pricing models  
✓ Document competitive advantages and market positioning
✓ Generate structured findings in markdown format

## Implementation Steps
1. Initialize research using remote MCP server
2. Conduct Brave Search queries for AI development tools
3. Extract key information about each tool:
   - Product name and company
   - Core features and capabilities
   - Pricing model and availability
   - Market positioning and target audience
4. Process and structure data using local MCP server
5. Generate markdown report with findings
6. Save research artifacts locally for next tasks

## Key Research Areas
- Code generation tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code)
- AI-powered IDEs and extensions
- Developer productivity platforms
- Pricing and business models
- Market adoption and user feedback

## Output Requirements
- Structured markdown report: `research/ai-tools-landscape.md`
- Raw data files for processing in subsequent tasks
- Summary of findings for integration with other research

## Testing Notes
This task validates:
- Remote MCP server connectivity and Brave Search integration
- Local MCP server file operations
- End-to-end data flow from web research to local storage
- Report generation capabilities

## Estimated Effort
2-3 hours including research, analysis, and report generation.
