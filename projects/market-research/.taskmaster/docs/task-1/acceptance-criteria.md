  - [ ] Search results properly processed and extracted

### 4. Local MCP Server Usage
- [ ] **File System Operations**
  - [ ] Successfully connected to filesystem MCP server
  - [ ] Created required output directories
  - [ ] Saved all required files without errors

## Output Deliverables

### Primary Report
- [ ] **File Created**: `research/ai-tools-landscape.md`
- [ ] **Report Structure**:
  - [ ] Executive summary section present
  - [ ] Individual tool profiles (5-7 tools)
  - [ ] Competitive analysis section
  - [ ] Market trends section
  - [ ] Recommendations section

- [ ] **Content Quality**:
  - [ ] Professional formatting with proper markdown
  - [ ] Consistent structure across tool profiles
  - [ ] No placeholder content
  - [ ] Minimum 2000 words total

### Supporting Data
- [ ] **File Created**: `research/raw-data.json`
- [ ] **Data Structure**:
  - [ ] Valid JSON format
  - [ ] Contains structured data for all researched tools
  - [ ] Includes metadata (research date, sources)

## Technical Validation

### MCP Server Integration
- [ ] **Remote Server Tests**:
  - [ ] Brave Search queries return valid results
  - [ ] No authentication errors
  - [ ] Proper error handling for failed queries

- [ ] **Local Server Tests**:
  - [ ] File write operations successful
  - [ ] Directory creation successful
  - [ ] File paths correctly resolved

### Data Quality
- [ ] **Information Accuracy**:
  - [ ] No obviously outdated information (pre-2023)
  - [ ] Pricing information current as of research date
  - [ ] Feature lists reflect latest versions

- [ ] **Completeness**:
  - [ ] No "TBD" or "TODO" markers in final output
  - [ ] All required fields populated for each tool
  - [ ] No empty sections in report

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Tool Research Validation
**Given**: The research task is complete  
**When**: Reviewing the tool profiles  
**Then**: 
- Each tool should have all required information fields
- At least 5 tools should be documented
- Each tool should belong to a clear category

### Test Case 2: Report Structure Validation
**Given**: The markdown report is generated  
**When**: Parsing the report structure  
**Then**:
- All required sections should be present
- Each section should contain substantive content
- Formatting should be consistent throughout

### Test Case 3: Data File Validation
**Given**: The raw data JSON file is created  
**When**: Parsing the JSON structure  
**Then**:
- JSON should be valid and parseable
- Should contain arrays/objects for each tool
- Should include research metadata

### Test Case 4: MCP Server Integration
**Given**: The task execution is complete  
**When**: Reviewing execution logs  
**Then**:
- Should show successful Brave Search queries
- Should show successful file write operations
- Should show no critical errors

## Edge Cases

### Handled Scenarios
- [ ] Less than 5 tools found: Document why and provide detailed analysis of available tools
- [ ] Search API rate limiting: Implement retry logic with backoff
- [ ] Missing pricing information: Note as "Pricing not publicly available"
- [ ] File write failures: Retry with alternative paths

### Error Conditions
- [ ] Complete Brave Search failure: Task fails, requires manual intervention
- [ ] Complete filesystem access failure: Task fails, requires permission fix
- [ ] Invalid JSON generation: Task fails, requires code fix

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] 5-7 tools researched âœ“
- [ ] 100% of required fields documented
- [ ] 0 critical errors during execution
- [ ] All files successfully created

### Qualitative
- [ ] Report provides actionable insights
- [ ] Comparisons are fair and balanced
- [ ] Information is current and relevant
- [ ] Output is professional and well-structured
