# Task 1: Research AI Development Tools Landscape

## Overview
This task conducts comprehensive web research on the current AI development tools ecosystem, focusing on code generation and developer productivity solutions. The research leverages remote MCP server capabilities for web search and local MCP for data processing and report generation.

## Technical Implementation Guide

### 1. Research Infrastructure Setup
```bash
# Verify MCP server connectivity
# Remote: Brave Search API via MCP server
# Local: File system operations via MCP server
```

### 2. Research Query Strategy
Implement focused search queries to maximize relevance while minimizing API usage:

#### Primary Research Queries:
- `"AI code generation tools 2024 comparison"`
- `"GitHub Copilot vs Cursor vs Claude Code"`
- `"AI developer productivity platforms pricing"`
- `"best AI coding assistants market share"`

#### Secondary Research Areas:
- Enterprise adoption patterns
- Developer community feedback
- Integration capabilities
- Security and privacy considerations

### 3. Data Collection Structure
```json
{
  "tool_name": {
    "company": "string",
    "core_features": ["feature1", "feature2"],
    "pricing": {
      "model": "subscription/usage",
      "tiers": []
    },
    "market_position": "string",
    "target_audience": "string",
    "unique_advantages": []
  }
}
```

### 4. Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Initialize Research Session
- Configure remote MCP server connection for Brave Search
- Set up local file system structure for research artifacts
- Create `research/` directory for output files

#### Step 2: Execute Primary Research
- Perform systematic searches for each major AI tool
- Focus on tools: GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, Codeium, Tabnine
- Gather pricing, features, and market positioning data

#### Step 3: Data Processing Pipeline
```python
# Pseudocode for data processing
for tool in ai_tools:
    search_results = brave_search(f"{tool} features pricing 2024")
    tool_data = extract_structured_data(search_results)
    validate_data(tool_data)
    save_to_local(tool_data)
```

#### Step 4: Analysis and Synthesis
- Compare feature sets across tools
- Analyze pricing models and value propositions
- Identify market gaps and opportunities
- Create competitive positioning matrix

#### Step 5: Report Generation
Generate structured markdown report with:
- Executive summary
- Tool-by-tool analysis
- Comparative feature matrix
- Pricing comparison table
- Market insights and trends

### 5. Output File Structure
```
research/
├── ai-tools-landscape.md      # Main comprehensive report
├── raw-data/
│   ├── search-results.json    # Raw search data
│   └── tool-profiles.json     # Structured tool data
└── summaries/
    └── executive-summary.md   # High-level findings
```

### 6. Quality Assurance
- Verify all major tools are covered
- Cross-reference pricing information
- Validate feature comparisons
- Ensure data recency (2024 information)

### 7. Integration Points
- **Task 2 Dependency**: Research findings feed into development environment analysis
- **Task 3 Dependency**: Data supports final synthesis and recommendations
- **Data Format**: JSON structure for easy parsing in subsequent tasks

## Error Handling
- Handle API rate limits gracefully
- Implement retry logic for failed searches
- Fall back to cached data if available
- Log all errors for debugging

## Performance Optimization
- Batch similar queries to reduce API calls
- Cache search results locally
- Use specific search operators for precision
- Limit result depth to relevant information

## Security Considerations
- No storage of API keys in code or reports
- Public information only (no proprietary data)
- Sanitize all collected data
- Follow web scraping best practices
