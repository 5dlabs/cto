# Task 1: Research AI Development Tools Landscape

## Overview
This task conducts comprehensive web research on current AI development tools and frameworks, focusing on code generation and developer productivity tools. It leverages remote MCP servers for web research and local MCP servers for data processing and report generation.

## Technical Requirements

### MCP Server Integration
- **Remote MCP Server**: Brave Search API for web research
- **Local MCP Server**: File system operations for report generation and data storage

### Research Scope
- Top 5-7 AI development tools in the market
- Code generation tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code)
- AI-powered IDEs and extensions
- Developer productivity platforms

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Initialize MCP Servers
```javascript
// Initialize remote MCP server connection
const braveSearchServer = await connectToMCP('brave-search');

// Initialize local file system server
const fileSystemServer = await connectToMCP('filesystem', {
  rootPath: '/tmp'
});
```

### Step 2: Execute Web Research
Conduct systematic searches to gather market intelligence:

1. **Search for AI Development Tools**
   - Query: "AI code generation tools 2024"
   - Query: "developer productivity AI tools comparison"
   - Query: "GitHub Copilot alternatives"

2. **Gather Tool Information**
   For each tool found, extract:
   - Product name and company
   - Core features and capabilities
   - Pricing model and availability
   - Market positioning and target audience
   - User feedback and adoption metrics

### Step 3: Process Research Data
Structure the collected data into a standardized format:

```javascript
const toolData = {
  name: "Tool Name",
  company: "Company Name",
  features: ["Feature 1", "Feature 2"],
  pricing: {
    model: "subscription/freemium/enterprise",
    tiers: []
  },
  marketPosition: "Description",
  targetAudience: "Developers/Teams/Enterprises"
};
```

### Step 4: Generate Markdown Report
Create a comprehensive report with the following structure:

```markdown
# AI Development Tools Landscape Report

## Executive Summary
[Key findings and market trends]

## Tool Analysis
### 1. [Tool Name]
- **Company**: [Company Name]
- **Core Features**: [List of features]
- **Pricing**: [Pricing model]
- **Market Position**: [Analysis]

[Repeat for each tool]

## Competitive Analysis
[Comparison matrix and differentiators]

## Market Trends
[Emerging patterns and future outlook]

## Recommendations
[Strategic insights based on research]
```

### Step 5: Save Research Artifacts
Store all research data and reports locally:

```javascript
// Save main report
await fileSystemServer.writeFile(
  'research/ai-tools-landscape.md',
  reportContent
);

// Save raw data for future processing
await fileSystemServer.writeFile(
  'research/raw-data.json',
  JSON.stringify(collectedData)
);
```

## Data Flow Architecture

```
[Brave Search API] → [Research Queries] → [Data Collection]
                                               ↓
                                        [Data Processing]
                                               ↓
[Local File System] ← [Report Generation] ← [Structured Data]
```

## Error Handling

### API Rate Limiting
- Implement exponential backoff for Brave Search queries
- Cache search results to minimize repeated queries

### Data Validation
- Verify all required fields are present before report generation
- Handle missing data gracefully with appropriate fallbacks

### File System Operations
- Check write permissions before saving reports
- Implement atomic writes to prevent data corruption

## Testing Approach

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual search query functions
   - Validate data extraction logic
   - Test report generation templates

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Verify MCP server connectivity
   - Test end-to-end workflow from search to report
   - Validate file system operations

3. **Validation Criteria**
   - Minimum 5 tools researched
   - All required data fields populated
   - Report generated in correct format
   - Files saved to correct locations

## Performance Considerations

- **API Usage**: Minimize Brave Search queries through intelligent query design
- **Processing**: Stream data processing to handle large result sets
- **Storage**: Compress raw data files if exceeding 10MB

## Security Notes

- No sensitive API keys in code or logs
- Sanitize all web content before processing
- Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal

## Dependencies

- Remote MCP Server: brave-search
- Local MCP Server: filesystem
- Node.js runtime for orchestration
- Markdown processing libraries (optional)
