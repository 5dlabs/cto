# Task 1: Research AI Development Tools Landscape

## Task Overview
This task involves conducting comprehensive market research on AI development tools and frameworks, focusing on code generation and developer productivity solutions. The research will leverage remote MCP servers for web search capabilities and local MCP servers for data processing and report generation.

## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Remote MCP server access with Brave Search integration
- Local MCP server for file operations
- Market research framework understanding

### Step 1: Initialize Research Environment
1. Verify remote MCP server connectivity for Brave Search
2. Set up local directories for research artifacts
3. Prepare data collection templates

### Step 2: Web Research Execution
Execute targeted Brave Search queries to gather information:

```
Primary search queries:
- "AI code generation tools 2025 comparison"
- "GitHub Copilot vs Cursor vs Claude Code features"
- "Developer productivity AI tools pricing models"
- "AI IDE extensions market analysis"
```

### Step 3: Data Collection Framework
For each identified tool, collect:
- **Product Information**: Name, company, founding year
- **Core Features**: Code generation, debugging, refactoring capabilities
- **Technology Stack**: LLMs used, integration methods
- **Pricing Model**: Free tier, paid plans, enterprise options
- **Market Position**: User base, key differentiators
- **Integration**: IDE support, API availability

### Step 4: Competitive Analysis
Create comparison matrix covering:
- Feature parity analysis
- Pricing competitiveness
- Market penetration
- User satisfaction metrics
- Technology advantages

### Step 5: Report Generation
Structure findings into comprehensive markdown report:
1. Executive summary of market landscape
2. Detailed tool profiles (5-7 tools)
3. Comparative analysis matrix
4. Market trends and insights
5. Recommendations for further research

### Step 6: Data Persistence
Save all research artifacts:
- Raw search results
- Structured data files
- Final markdown report
- Supporting documentation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Remote MCP Integration
- Use `brave_web_search` tool for market research
- Implement pagination for comprehensive results
- Filter by recency for current market data

### Local Processing
- Use `write_file` for saving research data
- Implement `read_file` for data aggregation
- Structure data using JSON for later processing

### Error Handling
- Validate search results before processing
- Implement retry logic for failed searches
- Ensure data integrity during file operations

## Expected Outputs
1. `research/ai-tools-landscape.md` - Main research report
2. `research/data/tools-comparison.json` - Structured comparison data
3. `research/data/raw-search-results.json` - Raw research data
4. `research/summary.md` - Executive summary

## Validation Criteria
- Minimum 5 AI development tools researched
- Complete feature comparison matrix
- Pricing information for all tools
- Market positioning analysis
- Structured, readable report format
