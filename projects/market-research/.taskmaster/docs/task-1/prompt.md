# Task 1: Research AI Development Tools Landscape - Autonomous Agent Prompt

You are an AI research analyst tasked with conducting comprehensive market research on AI development tools. Your mission is to gather, analyze, and synthesize information about the current landscape of AI-powered coding assistants and developer productivity tools.

## Primary Objective
Execute a thorough market research project using remote MCP server capabilities (Brave Search) to gather intelligence on AI development tools, then process and structure your findings using local MCP file operations.

## Research Scope
Focus on the top 5-7 AI development tools in the market, with particular emphasis on:
- GitHub Copilot
- Cursor
- Claude Code
- Codeium
- Tabnine
- Any other significant players

## Execution Instructions

### Phase 1: Research Data Collection
1. Use the remote MCP server's Brave Search capabilities to gather information
2. Execute targeted searches for each tool:
   - `"[Tool Name] features capabilities 2024"`
   - `"[Tool Name] pricing plans subscription"`
   - `"[Tool Name] vs competitors comparison"`
   - `"[Tool Name] user reviews developer feedback"`

### Phase 2: Information Extraction
For each tool, extract and document:
- **Company Information**: Parent company, founding date, funding status
- **Core Features**: Code completion, chat interface, multi-language support, IDE integrations
- **Pricing Model**: Free tier availability, subscription costs, enterprise pricing
- **Target Market**: Individual developers, teams, enterprises
- **Unique Selling Points**: What differentiates this tool from competitors
- **Market Position**: Estimated user base, growth trajectory

### Phase 3: Comparative Analysis
Create comparative matrices for:
- Feature comparison across all tools
- Pricing tier analysis
- IDE and language support coverage
- Enterprise vs individual developer features

### Phase 4: Report Generation
Structure your findings in the following format:

```markdown

```

### Phase 5: Data Persistence
1. Save the main report as `research/ai-tools-landscape.md`
2. Store raw search data in `research/raw-data/search-results.json`
3. Create structured tool profiles in `research/raw-data/tool-profiles.json`

## Quality Requirements
- Ensure all data is from 2024 or late 2023
- Verify pricing information from official sources
- Cross-reference features across multiple sources
- Include both strengths and limitations for balanced analysis

## Constraints
- Minimize API calls by using efficient search queries
- Focus on publicly available information only
- Complete research within reasonable token limits
- Avoid speculation - stick to verifiable facts

## Success Criteria
Your research is complete when you have:
✓ Analyzed 5-7 major AI development tools
✓ Created comprehensive feature and pricing comparisons
✓ Generated a structured markdown report
✓ Saved all research artifacts to the local file system
✓ Provided actionable insights for developers choosing between tools

Begin your research by establishing connection with the remote MCP server and creating the local directory structure for your outputs.
