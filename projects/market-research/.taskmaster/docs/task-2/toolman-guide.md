# Toolman Guide: Analyze Local Development Environment Tools

## Overview
This guide explains how to use the selected tools for analyzing development environment platforms and integrating findings with AI tools research from Task 1. The task requires both web research capabilities and extensive local file operations for data integration.

## Core Tools

### 1. brave_web_search (Remote Tool)
**Purpose**: Research development environment platforms and gather market intelligence

**When to Use**:
- Searching for development environment comparisons
- Finding platform features and pricing
- Researching setup complexity and requirements
- Gathering performance benchmarks and user feedback

**How to Use**:
```json
{
  "query": "Docker Desktop vs GitHub Codespaces comparison 2025",
  "count": 20,
  "offset": 0
}
```

**Research Queries**:
- "GitHub Codespaces vs Gitpod features pricing"
- "VS Code Dev Containers setup automation guide"
- "Docker Desktop alternatives comparison 2025"
- "Cloud development environments performance benchmarks"
- "Local development tools AI integration"

### 2. read_text_file (Local Server Tool)
**Purpose**: Read Task 1 outputs and existing research data

**When to Use**:
- Loading AI tools research from Task 1
- Reading comparison data for integration
- Accessing previously saved research
- Validating data consistency

**How to Use**:
```json
{
  "path": "research/ai-tools-landscape.md"
}
```

**Critical Files to Read**:
- `research/ai-tools-landscape.md` - Main Task 1 report
- `research/data/tools-comparison.json` - Structured AI tools data
- `research/summary.md` - Executive summary from Task 1

### 3. read_multiple_files (Local Server Tool)
**Purpose**: Efficiently load multiple Task 1 outputs simultaneously

**When to Use**:
- Initial task setup to load all dependencies
- Batch processing of research data
- Cross-referencing multiple sources

**How to Use**:
```json
{
  "paths": [
    "research/ai-tools-landscape.md",
    "research/data/tools-comparison.json",
    "research/summary.md"
  ]
}
```

**Benefits**:
- More efficient than sequential reads
- Ensures all data loaded before processing
- Reduces risk of missing dependencies

## Supporting Tools

### 4. write_file (Local Server Tool)
**Purpose**: Save analysis results and generate reports

**When to Use**:
- Creating the main analysis report
- Saving structured comparison data
- Generating integration matrices
- Writing workflow recommendations

**Output Files**:
- `research/dev-environment-analysis.md` - Main analysis
- `research/data/environment-comparison.json` - Platform comparison
- `research/data/integration-matrix.json` - AI tools mapping
- `research/workflow-recommendations.md` - Practical guidance

### 5. create_directory (Local Server Tool)
**Purpose**: Ensure proper directory structure exists

**When to Use**:
- Before writing new files
- Organizing research outputs
- Creating subdirectories for data

### 6. list_directory (Local Server Tool)
**Purpose**: Verify file creation and check dependencies

**When to Use**:
- Confirming Task 1 outputs exist
- Validating file creation
- Checking directory structure

## Implementation Flow

### Phase 1: Dependency Loading
1. Use `list_directory` to verify Task 1 outputs exist
2. Use `read_multiple_files` to load all Task 1 data:
   ```json
   {
     "paths": [
       "research/ai-tools-landscape.md",
       "research/data/tools-comparison.json"
     ]
   }
   ```
3. Parse and validate loaded data

### Phase 2: Research Execution
1. Conduct web searches for each platform category:
   - Container-based environments
   - Cloud development platforms
   - Local automation tools
   - Hybrid solutions

2. For each platform, gather:
   - Features and capabilities
   - Pricing and cost structure
   - Performance characteristics
   - Integration possibilities

### Phase 3: Integration Analysis
1. Load AI tools data from Task 1
2. For each development environment:
   - Assess compatibility with each AI tool
   - Document integration procedures
   - Identify optimal combinations
   - Note limitations or conflicts

### Phase 4: Data Synthesis
1. Create comparison matrices
2. Generate integration mappings
3. Develop workflow recommendations
4. Structure all data for Task 3 consumption

## Best Practices

### Data Integration
- Always validate Task 1 data before processing
- Maintain consistent data structures
- Reference AI tools by exact names from Task 1
- Preserve original data while adding new insights

### Research Strategy
- Focus on platforms that complement AI tools
- Prioritize widely-used solutions
- Include both enterprise and individual options
- Consider different development scenarios

### File Management
- Read all dependencies at task start
- Save work incrementally
- Validate JSON structure before writing
- Use clear, consistent naming

## Common Patterns

### Platform Research Pattern
1. Search for platform overview and features
2. Find pricing and licensing information
3. Look for performance benchmarks
4. Search for AI tool integration guides
5. Compile into structured profile

### Integration Mapping Pattern
1. Load AI tool from Task 1 data
2. For each environment platform:
   - Check official compatibility
   - Search for integration guides
   - Assess performance impact
   - Rate integration complexity
3. Create mapping entry

### Comparison Pattern
1. Define comparison criteria
2. Research each platform against criteria
3. Normalize data for fair comparison
4. Generate comparison matrix
5. Extract key insights

## Troubleshooting

### Dependency Issues
- If Task 1 files missing, check paths
- Validate JSON parsing before use
- Handle missing data gracefully
- Report clear error messages

### Integration Challenges
- Cross-reference multiple sources
- Look for community solutions
- Document workarounds
- Note platform limitations

## Success Indicators
- All Task 1 data successfully integrated
- 5+ platforms thoroughly analyzed
- Complete AI tools integration matrix
- Clear workflow recommendations
- All output files generated and valid
