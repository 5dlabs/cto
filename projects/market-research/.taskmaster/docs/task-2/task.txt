# Task 2: Analyze Local Development Environment Tools

## Overview
Research and analyze tools for local development environments, focusing on setup automation and developer experience improvements.

## Objective
Complement AI tools research with analysis of development environment platforms, comparing local vs cloud-based solutions.

## Dependencies
- Requires completion of Task 1 (AI Development Tools research)
- Uses findings from previous research for comparative analysis

## Requirements
- Remote MCP server for web research on dev environment tools
- Local MCP server for file analysis and report generation
- Integration with Task 1 findings for comprehensive analysis
- Focus on developer workflow and productivity aspects

## Acceptance Criteria
✓ Research development environment tools and platforms
✓ Compare local vs cloud-based solutions
✓ Analyze developer workflow integration capabilities
✓ Create comparative analysis report integrating Task 1 findings

## Implementation Steps
1. Use remote MCP server to research development environment tools:
   - Docker Desktop and containerization platforms
   - VS Code Dev Containers and similar solutions
   - GitHub Codespaces and cloud development environments
   - Local development automation tools
2. Read and analyze findings from Task 1 using local MCP server
3. Create comparative analysis between:
   - AI tools vs environment tools
   - Local vs cloud-based solutions
   - Integration capabilities and workflow impact
4. Generate structured report combining both research areas
5. Save analysis for final synthesis in Task 3

## Key Research Areas
- Container-based development environments
- Cloud vs local development trade-offs
- Developer onboarding and setup automation
- Integration with AI development tools
- Cost and complexity considerations

## Output Requirements
- Comparative analysis report: `research/dev-environment-analysis.md`
- Integration notes connecting to AI tools research
- Data structured for final synthesis task
- Workflow recommendations based on findings

## Testing Notes
This task validates:
- Integration between tasks using local file operations
- Combined remote research and local analysis capabilities
- Data processing and synthesis workflows
- Multi-task dependency handling

## Estimated Effort
1-2 hours including research, analysis, and comparative report generation.
