# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Structure and Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with React frontend and Node.js backend, configure TypeScript, and set up development environment with Docker. Research best practices for project structure and container deployment configurations.
# Details:
1. Research best practices for React + Node.js project structure using web search
2. Investigate Rust documentation for containerization patterns and best practices
3. Research Kubernetes container orchestration requirements for future deployment
4. Create a monorepo structure with separate folders for frontend and backend
5. Initialize React 18+ with TypeScript using create-react-app or Vite
6. Set up Node.js Express backend with TypeScript
7. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
8. Create Docker and docker-compose files for development based on research findings
9. Design container deployment configurations with Kubernetes compatibility in mind
10. Set up environment variables for different environments
11. Configure package.json scripts for development, testing, and building
12. Initialize Git repository with appropriate .gitignore

Folder structure:
```
/chat-application
  /frontend
    /src
    package.json
    tsconfig.json
  /backend
    /src
    package.json
    tsconfig.json
  /kubernetes
    /deployment-configs
  docker-compose.yml
  .gitignore
  README.md
```

Required tools:
- LOCAL: File operations for creating project structure and configuration files
- REMOTE: Web search for React/Node.js best practices
- REMOTE: Rust documentation for containerization patterns
- REMOTE: Kubernetes documentation for container orchestration

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all development scripts work correctly. Test Docker setup by building and running containers. Ensure hot reloading works for both frontend and backend development. Validate that container configurations align with Kubernetes best practices. Document research findings on project structure and deployment patterns.
