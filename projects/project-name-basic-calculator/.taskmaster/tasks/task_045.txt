# Test Strategy:
Run security scanning tools, attempt XSS attacks, verify CSP headers work correctly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Scan for XSS vulnerabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform comprehensive XSS vulnerability scanning across all user input points and display outputs
### Details:
Review all places where user input is accepted (calculator display, button clicks). Check for proper input sanitization. Verify innerHTML usage is safe. Test with malicious input patterns like <script>alert('XSS')</script>. Use automated XSS scanning tools if available

## 2. Review code for security best practices [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.1
### Description: Audit JavaScript code for common security issues and best practices compliance
### Details:
Check for eval() or Function() constructor usage. Verify no dynamic code execution. Review event handlers for security. Ensure proper input validation. Check for exposed sensitive data. Verify HTTPS usage in production environment. Review third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities

## 3. Implement security headers [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.2
### Description: Add Content Security Policy and other security headers to enhance application security
### Details:
Implement Content-Security-Policy header to prevent XSS attacks. Add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff. Include X-Frame-Options: DENY to prevent clickjacking. Set Referrer-Policy for privacy. Test headers using browser developer tools and online security header analyzers
