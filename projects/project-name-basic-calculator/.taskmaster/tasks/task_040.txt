# Title: Optimize CSS for Production
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 35
# Priority: medium
# Description: Minify and optimize CSS for production deployment
# Details:
Remove unused CSS, combine similar rules, minify CSS file. Consider using CSS custom properties for all colors and sizes. Remove any commented code. Use CSS autoprefixer for browser compatibility

# Test Strategy:

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit and Remove Unused CSS Rules [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze CSS file to identify and remove any unused selectors, rules, and declarations
### Details:
Use browser DevTools Coverage tab to identify unused CSS. Remove any rules not applied to elements, delete commented-out code, remove vendor prefixes that will be added by autoprefixer. Check for duplicate declarations and remove redundant rules.

## 2. Consolidate and Optimize Selectors [pending]

### Description: Combine similar rules, optimize selector specificity, and implement CSS custom properties
### Details:
Group selectors with identical properties, simplify overly specific selectors, convert all color values and repeated sizes to CSS custom properties defined in :root. Combine media queries where possible. Ensure selector performance by avoiding universal selectors and deep nesting.

## 3. Minify CSS and Add Autoprefixer [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.2
### Description: Process CSS through minification and autoprefixer tools for production deployment
### Details:
Use CSS minifier (cssnano or clean-css) to remove whitespace, shorten color values, and optimize code. Run autoprefixer to add vendor prefixes for browser compatibility. Generate source map for debugging. Compare file size before and after optimization.
