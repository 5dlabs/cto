# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Button Grid Layout
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Use CSS Grid to create a 4x4 button layout for the calculator
# Details:
Style .buttons container: display: grid, grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr), gap: 10px. This creates equal-width columns with consistent spacing between buttons

# Test Strategy:
Verify buttons are arranged in 4x4 grid, check spacing is consistent, ensure grid is responsive

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Basic Grid Container Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the .buttons container element with CSS Grid display property and define the basic grid structure
### Details:
Add CSS rule for .buttons container: display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); This establishes the grid context and creates 4 equal-width columns that will automatically adjust to the container width

## 2. Add Grid Gap Spacing [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement consistent spacing between grid items using the gap property
### Details:
Update .buttons CSS to include: gap: 10px; This creates uniform 10px spacing between all buttons both horizontally and vertically, replacing the need for individual margins

## 3. Configure Grid Auto-Flow and Alignment [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Set grid auto-flow behavior and ensure proper alignment of grid items
### Details:
Add to .buttons CSS: grid-auto-flow: row; align-items: stretch; justify-items: stretch; This ensures buttons fill from left to right, row by row, and stretch to fill their grid cells completely

## 4. Handle Special Button Spans [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Implement CSS for buttons that need to span multiple grid cells (like equals or zero button)
### Details:
Add CSS classes for special buttons: .button-wide { grid-column: span 2; } for buttons that should take up 2 columns. Apply to zero button or equals button as needed in the layout

## 5. Add Responsive Grid Adjustments [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Ensure the grid layout remains functional and visually appealing on different screen sizes
### Details:
Add media query for smaller screens: @media (max-width: 400px) { .buttons { gap: 5px; } } This reduces spacing on small screens. Also ensure grid container has appropriate max-width and padding for optimal display
