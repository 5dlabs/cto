# Task ID: 46
# Title: Add Performance Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 44
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement basic performance metrics tracking
# Details:
Add performance marks for key operations: page load, first interaction, calculation time. Log to console in development. Consider integrating with analytics service for production

# Test Strategy:
Verify performance marks are recorded, check timing data is accurate, ensure no performance impact

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add performance marks for key operations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Instrument the code with performance marks to measure page load, first interaction, and calculation time
### Details:
Use Performance API to add marks: performance.mark('page-load-start') at DOM ready, performance.mark('first-interaction') on first button click, performance.mark('calculation-start') and performance.mark('calculation-end') around evaluate() function. Use performance.measure() to calculate durations between marks

## 2. Create performance logging system [pending]
### Dependencies: 46.1
### Description: Implement a logging system to capture and display performance metrics in development mode
### Details:
Create a performanceLogger object with methods to log timing data. In development mode, use console.table() to display metrics. Include: page load time, time to first interaction, average calculation time, and number of calculations performed. Store metrics in localStorage for session analysis

## 3. Consider analytics integration for production [pending]
### Dependencies: 46.2
### Description: Plan and implement optional analytics service integration for production performance monitoring
### Details:
Research lightweight analytics options (Google Analytics, Simple Analytics, or custom solution). Create abstraction layer for analytics calls. Send custom events for: page load performance, calculation frequency, error rates. Ensure analytics code is conditionally loaded only in production environment
