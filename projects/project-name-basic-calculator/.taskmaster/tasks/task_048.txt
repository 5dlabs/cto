# Task ID: 48
# Title: Implement Feedback Changes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 47
# Priority: high
# Description: Address issues discovered during user testing
# Details:
Review user feedback, prioritize changes by impact and effort. Common issues might include: button size on mobile, unclear error messages, missing features. Implement high-priority fixes

# Test Strategy:
Verify each reported issue is addressed, re-test with users if possible, ensure no regressions

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze and Categorize User Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review all user feedback from testing sessions and organize it into categories such as UI/UX issues, functionality bugs, missing features, and performance concerns
### Details:
Create a feedback tracking document with columns for: issue description, category (UI/UX, functionality, feature request, performance), severity (critical, high, medium, low), affected component, and user count. Review all feedback and populate the tracking document systematically

## 2. Prioritize Issues by Impact and Effort [pending]
### Dependencies: 48.1
### Description: Evaluate each categorized issue based on user impact and implementation effort to create a prioritized fix list
### Details:
Use an impact/effort matrix to score each issue. Impact factors: number of users affected, severity of issue, business value. Effort factors: code complexity, testing requirements, potential for regression. Create ordered list with high-impact/low-effort items first

## 3. Implement High-Priority Fixes [pending]
### Dependencies: 48.2
### Description: Code and test solutions for the top-priority issues identified in the prioritization phase
### Details:
Start with top 5-10 issues from priority list. For each fix: create a branch, implement solution, test thoroughly including edge cases, ensure no regressions in existing functionality. Common fixes might include: adjusting button sizes for mobile, clarifying error messages, fixing calculation bugs

## 4. Verify Fixes Address Reported Issues [pending]
### Dependencies: 48.3
### Description: Validate that implemented fixes successfully resolve the original user-reported problems without introducing new issues
### Details:
For each implemented fix: reproduce the original issue to confirm it existed, apply the fix and verify issue is resolved, test related functionality for regressions, document the fix and testing results. If possible, have original reporters verify the fixes meet their needs
