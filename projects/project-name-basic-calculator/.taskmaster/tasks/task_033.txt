# Task ID: 33
# Title: Create Loading Animation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Add subtle loading animation when page first loads
# Details:
Create CSS animation: @keyframes fadeIn { from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(20px); } to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); } } Apply to calculator with animation: fadeIn 0.5s ease-out

# Test Strategy:
Verify animation plays on page load, check animation is smooth, ensure no layout shift occurs

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define CSS Keyframe Animation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the fadeIn keyframe animation in the CSS file that will handle the opacity and transform transitions
### Details:
Add the following CSS code to styles.css: @keyframes fadeIn { from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(20px); } to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); } }. Place this at the top of the CSS file or in a dedicated animations section.

## 2. Apply Animation to Calculator Container [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Add the animation property to the main calculator container element to trigger the fadeIn animation on page load
### Details:
Locate the main calculator container selector (likely .calculator or #calculator) and add the CSS property: animation: fadeIn 0.5s ease-out; This will apply the animation with a duration of 0.5 seconds and an ease-out timing function.

## 3. Set Initial Opacity State [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.2
### Description: Ensure the calculator starts with opacity 0 to prevent flash of content before animation begins
### Details:
Add opacity: 0; to the calculator container's initial CSS rules. Then add animation-fill-mode: forwards; to the animation property to maintain the final animation state (opacity: 1) after completion. The full animation property should be: animation: fadeIn 0.5s ease-out forwards;

## 4. Add Animation Delay for Better UX [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.3
### Description: Implement a slight delay before the animation starts to ensure all assets are loaded
### Details:
Modify the animation property to include a small delay: animation: fadeIn 0.5s ease-out 0.1s forwards; This adds a 100ms delay before the animation begins, ensuring fonts and other resources are loaded first.

## 5. Optimize for Performance and Accessibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.4
### Description: Add performance optimizations and respect user preferences for reduced motion
### Details:
Add will-change: opacity, transform; to the calculator container before animation to optimize rendering. Also add a media query to respect reduced motion preferences: @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { .calculator { animation: none; opacity: 1; } }. This ensures users who prefer reduced motion see the calculator immediately without animation.
