# Task ID: 41
# Title: Optimize JavaScript for Production
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 38
# Priority: medium
# Description: Minify and optimize JavaScript for production deployment
# Details:
Minify JavaScript using tool like Terser or UglifyJS. Remove console.log statements, remove commented code, optimize function calls. Consider using ES6 modules if appropriate

# Test Strategy:
Verify minified code works identically to original, check file size reduction, test all functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Remove Debug Code and Console Statements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Clean up JavaScript code by removing all console.log statements, debug code, and commented-out code blocks
### Details:
Search through all JavaScript files for console.log, console.error, console.warn, and other console methods. Remove or comment them out for production. Remove any debug flags, test data, or development-only code. Clean up commented code that is no longer needed. Consider using a tool like babel-plugin-transform-remove-console for automated removal

## 2. Set Up JavaScript Minification Process [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.1
### Description: Configure and implement a minification tool like Terser or UglifyJS to compress JavaScript files
### Details:
Install Terser via npm (npm install terser --save-dev). Create a build script in package.json or a separate build file. Configure minification options: mangle variable names, compress code, remove whitespace, preserve necessary comments (licenses). Set up source maps for debugging if needed. Test the minification process and verify output

## 3. Optimize Function Calls and Reduce Code Redundancy [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.1
### Description: Review and refactor JavaScript code to eliminate redundant function calls, optimize loops, and improve overall efficiency
### Details:
Cache DOM queries to avoid repeated lookups. Combine similar functions where possible. Use const/let appropriately instead of var. Optimize event handlers by using event delegation where applicable. Remove duplicate code by creating reusable functions. Consider implementing debouncing for rapid button clicks. Review and optimize any loops or recursive functions
