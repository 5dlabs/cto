# Task ID: 29
# Title: Optimize Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 27
# Priority: low
# Description: Review and optimize JavaScript for better performance
# Details:
Minimize DOM queries by caching elements, use const where possible, remove unnecessary function calls, consider debouncing rapid button clicks if needed. Profile using browser dev tools

# Test Strategy:
Use browser performance profiler, measure initial load time, test rapid button clicking performance

# Subtasks:
## 1. Profile and Identify Performance Bottlenecks [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Use browser developer tools to profile current application performance and identify specific bottlenecks
### Details:
Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab to record runtime performance during typical user interactions. Analyze flame charts to identify slow functions, measure JavaScript execution time, check for layout thrashing, and document findings. Focus on calculator operations, theme switching, and any DOM manipulation bottlenecks.

## 2. Optimize DOM Queries and Event Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Refactor code to minimize DOM queries and optimize event handling patterns
### Details:
Cache frequently accessed DOM elements at initialization, replace multiple querySelector calls with stored references, implement event delegation for calculator buttons instead of individual listeners, add debouncing for rapid button clicks if performance profiling shows it's needed. Store theme toggle and display elements as constants.

## 3. Implement Performance Best Practices [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.2
### Description: Apply JavaScript performance optimizations and verify improvements
### Details:
Replace var with const/let throughout codebase, optimize calculation functions to avoid unnecessary operations, remove any console.log statements, minimize function calls in loops, use requestAnimationFrame for any animations. Run performance profiler again to measure improvements and ensure at least 20% reduction in script execution time.
