		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Toolchain",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup process into subtasks such as: initializing the Rust project, installing Rust and required tools, configuring Docker, setting up IDE and extensions, and preparing project documentation files.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple setup steps but each is relatively standard and well-documented. The complexity is moderate due to the number of tools and initial configuration required, but there are few decision points or intricate dependencies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Define gRPC Service Contracts",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for designing user service proto, board service proto, task service proto, and validating/generating code from proto files.",
			"reasoning": "Designing service contracts requires careful planning and understanding of the domain. There are multiple services and message types, and errors here propagate downstream. However, the task is mostly design and validation, not implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Database Schema and ORM",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for schema design, writing migrations, configuring Diesel, generating schema.rs, implementing models, and verifying with test queries.",
			"reasoning": "Database schema design and ORM setup involve multiple interdependent steps, require domain modeling, and mistakes can be costly. There is moderate to high complexity due to the need for migrations, model relationships, and tooling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Management Service",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for implementing registration endpoint, login endpoint, password hashing, JWT generation, input validation, error handling, and writing tests.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves security-sensitive logic (authentication, password storage, JWT), multiple async flows, and robust error handling. It is complex due to the need for correctness, security, and integration with other components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Project Board CRUD Service",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for create, read, update, delete endpoints, authorization checks, database integration, and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "CRUD operations are standard, but authorization and integration with the database add complexity. Ensuring correct permissions and error handling increases the number of considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Task CRUD and Assignment Service",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for create, read, update, delete task endpoints, assignment logic, field validation, database integration, and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to board CRUD, but with additional assignment logic and more fields to validate. Complexity is increased by the need to handle assignment and status updates robustly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Real-Time Updates via gRPC Streams",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for designing streaming endpoints, implementing server-side streaming, client handling, connection lifecycle management, error handling, and testing with multiple clients.",
			"reasoning": "Real-time streaming introduces concurrency, lifecycle management, and error handling challenges. Bidirectional streaming is inherently complex and requires careful design and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Structured Logging and Error Handling",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for integrating tracing, defining custom error types, instrumenting key events, handling errors gracefully, and verifying log output.",
			"reasoning": "While logging and error handling are cross-cutting concerns, integrating structured logging and robust error handling requires thoughtful design but is not as complex as core business logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Write Comprehensive Unit and Integration Tests",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for unit tests for each service, integration tests for gRPC endpoints, database operation tests, error case tests, test container setup, and coverage verification.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive testing is critical and involves multiple layers (unit, integration, error cases). Setting up test containers and ensuring coverage adds to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Prepare Deployment Artifacts and Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for writing Dockerfile, creating Kubernetes manifests, documenting environment variables, writing deployment steps, and verifying deployment.",
			"reasoning": "Deployment preparation involves multiple artifacts and documentation, but each step is well-defined. Complexity is moderate due to the need for accuracy and completeness."
