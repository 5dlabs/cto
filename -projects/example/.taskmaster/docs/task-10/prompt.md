# Autonomous Prompt for Task 10: Prepare Deployment Artifacts and Documentation

## Context

You are preparing the Task Board API for production deployment. The application is fully implemented with all features working and tests passing. Your goal is to create production-ready deployment artifacts that ensure the application can be deployed reliably, securely, and efficiently in cloud environments.

### Project State
- All features implemented and tested (Tasks 1-9 complete)
- Application runs successfully in development
- Tests pass with >80% coverage
- Ready for containerization and deployment

### Deployment Philosophy
- Security first: Run as non-root, minimal attack surface
- Efficiency: Small container images, fast startup times
- Reliability: Health checks, graceful shutdown, proper logging
- Scalability: Horizontal scaling ready, stateless design
- Maintainability: Clear documentation, easy configuration

## Task Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. Create optimized production Dockerfile
2. Write Kubernetes manifests for deployment
3. Document all environment variables
4. Create deployment automation scripts
5. Write comprehensive deployment guide
6. Implement security best practices
7. Prepare monitoring configuration

### Deployment Targets
- **Container**: Docker image optimized for production
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes 1.24+ compatible manifests
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration
- **Security**: Non-root user, security policies
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, metrics endpoints

## Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Create Production Dockerfile
Use multi-stage build for optimization:
```dockerfile
# Build stage with all dependencies
FROM rust:1.75-slim as builder
# Install build dependencies
# Copy and build application

# Runtime stage with minimal dependencies
FROM debian:bookworm-slim
# Install only runtime dependencies
# Copy binary from builder
# Run as non-root user
```

Key requirements:
- Cache dependency building
- Minimize final image size
- Include health check
- Set proper permissions

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes Manifests
Organize in `k8s/` directory:
- `namespace.yaml`: Dedicated namespace
- `configmap.yaml`: Non-sensitive configuration
- `secret.yaml`: Sensitive configuration
- `deployment.yaml`: Application deployment
- `service.yaml`: Service exposure
- `network-policy.yaml`: Security policies

Deployment requirements:
- 3 replicas minimum
- Resource limits and requests
- Liveness and readiness probes
- Security context

### Step 3: Document Environment Variables
Create comprehensive table:
- Variable name
- Description
- Required/Optional
- Default value
- Example value
- Security notes

Include all variables:
- Database connection
- JWT configuration
- Logging settings
- Connection pools
- Feature flags

### Step 4: Create Deployment Scripts
Automation scripts in `scripts/`:
- `build.sh`: Build and tag images
- `deploy.sh`: Deploy to Kubernetes
- `rollback.sh`: Rollback deployment
- `health-check.sh`: Verify deployment

Make scripts idempotent and safe.

### Step 5: Write Deployment Documentation
Create `DEPLOYMENT.md` with:
- Prerequisites
- Quick start guide
- Detailed deployment steps
- Configuration guide
- Monitoring setup
- Troubleshooting guide
- Rollback procedures

### Step 6: Optional Helm Chart
If time permits, create Helm chart:
- Parameterized deployment
- Values for different environments
- Chart testing
- Release management

## Success Criteria

### Docker Image
- [ ] Image builds successfully
- [ ] Final image size < 200MB
- [ ] Runs as non-root user (UID 1001)
- [ ] Health check endpoint works
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities (scan with trivy)
- [ ] Proper signal handling for graceful shutdown

### Kubernetes Manifests
- [ ] All resources have proper labels
- [ ] Deployment has 3+ replicas
- [ ] Resource limits set appropriately
- [ ] Probes configured correctly
- [ ] Network policies restrict traffic
- [ ] Secrets not exposed in logs

### Documentation
- [ ] All environment variables documented
- [ ] Step-by-step deployment guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting section included
- [ ] Security considerations noted
- [ ] Monitoring setup explained
- [ ] Rollback procedures clear

### Scripts
- [ ] Build script handles versioning
- [ ] Deploy script is idempotent
- [ ] Scripts have error handling
- [ ] Scripts are well-commented
- [ ] Scripts tested in dry-run mode

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Security Issues**
   - Never include secrets in images
   - Always run as non-root
   - Don't expose unnecessary ports
   - Use specific base image versions

2. **Image Size**
   - Remove build dependencies
   - Use multi-stage builds
   - Clean up package manager cache
   - Only include necessary files

3. **Configuration**
   - Don't hardcode environment-specific values
   - Use ConfigMaps for non-sensitive data
   - Use Secrets for sensitive data
   - Validate all configuration

4. **Deployment**
   - Always use resource limits
   - Configure proper probes
   - Handle graceful shutdown
   - Use rolling updates

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t task-board-api:test .

# Run container locally
docker run --rm -p 50051:50051 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://... \
  -e JWT_SECRET=test-secret \
  task-board-api:test

# Test Kubernetes manifests
kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f k8s/

# Validate Helm chart
helm lint helm/task-board-api/
```

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Dockerfile**: Production-optimized container definition
2. **k8s/ directory**: All Kubernetes manifests
3. **scripts/ directory**: Deployment automation scripts
4. **DEPLOYMENT.md**: Comprehensive deployment guide
5. **docker-compose.yml**: Local development setup
6. **Environment documentation**: All variables documented
7. **Security checklist**: Verification of security practices
8. **(Optional) Helm chart**: Parameterized deployment

Remember: The deployment artifacts you create will be used by operations teams who may not be familiar with the application internals. Make everything clear, automated where possible, and include good error messages and troubleshooting guides.
