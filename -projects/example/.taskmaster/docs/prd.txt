# Task Board API - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Project Description
Task Board API is a collaborative task management service implemented as a Rust microservice using gRPC for communication. It provides real-time task tracking, user collaboration, and basic project management features. This serves as an example application to demonstrate the Task Master AI workflow integrated with the orchestrator platform.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Demonstrate end-to-end autonomous development using Task Master AI and Claude Code agents.
- Showcase Rust best practices with gRPC, async programming, and database integration.
- Provide a moderately complex application with multiple features for testing the AI development process.

### 1.3 Scope
- In Scope: User authentication, task CRUD, real-time updates via gRPC streams, basic project boards.
- Out of Scope: Front-end UI, advanced analytics, mobile apps.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements
1. User Management:
   - Register new users with email/password.
   - Authenticate users and generate JWT tokens.
   - User roles: Admin, Member.

2. Project Boards:
   - Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) project boards.
   - Boards contain multiple task lists (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).

3. Tasks:
   - CRUD operations for tasks within boards.
   - Task attributes: title, description, assignee, due date, status, priority.
   - Assign tasks to users.
   - Real-time updates via gRPC bidirectional streaming.

4. Collaboration:
   - Multiple users can join a board.
   - Real-time notifications for task changes.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Handle up to 100 concurrent users.
- Security: JWT authentication, input validation.
- Database: PostgreSQL for persistence.
- Logging: Structured logging with tracing.
- Error Handling: Graceful degradation, proper error messages.

## 3. Technical Specifications

### 3.1 Technology Stack
- Language: Rust (latest stable)
- gRPC: tonic for server and client
- Database: Diesel ORM with PostgreSQL
- Async Runtime: Tokio
- Authentication: JWT with jsonwebtoken crate
- Testing: Unit and integration tests using tokio::test

### 3.2 Architecture
- Monolithic service for simplicity.
- gRPC server with services for users, boards, tasks.
- Database schema: users, boards, board_members, tasks.
- Real-time features using gRPC streams.

## 4. Development Guidelines
- Follow Rust best practices and idioms.
- Use async/await where appropriate.
- Implement proper error handling with thiserror.
- Write comprehensive tests.
- Use tracing for observability.

## 5. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual functions.
- Integration tests for gRPC endpoints.
- Load testing for concurrent connections.

## 6. Deployment
- Docker container.
- Kubernetes deployment yaml.
- Environment variables for configuration.
