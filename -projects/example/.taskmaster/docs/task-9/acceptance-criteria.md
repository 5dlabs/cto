## Test Cases

### TC-1: Unit Test Verification
```bash
# Test Case 1.1: Run unit tests
cargo test --lib
# Expected: All unit tests pass

# Test Case 1.2: Verify test count
cargo test --lib -- --list | grep "test_" | wc -l
# Expected: > 100 unit tests

# Test Case 1.3: Check test execution time
cargo test --lib -- --nocapture 2>&1 | grep "test result"
# Expected: Execution time < 5 seconds
```

### TC-2: Integration Test Verification
```bash
# Test Case 2.1: Run integration tests
cargo test --test '*' -- --test-threads=1
# Expected: All integration tests pass

# Test Case 2.2: Verify container usage
docker ps | grep postgres
# Expected: PostgreSQL container running during tests

# Test Case 2.3: Test cleanup verification
cargo test --test '*' -- --test-threads=1 && docker ps | grep postgres | wc -l
# Expected: 0 (no containers left running)
```

### TC-3: Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Test Case 3.1: Generate coverage report
cargo tarpaulin --out Html
# Expected: Report generated successfully

# Test Case 3.2: Check overall coverage
cargo tarpaulin --print-summary
# Expected: Coverage > 80%

# Test Case 3.3: Verify excluded files
cargo tarpaulin --print-summary --verbose | grep -E "(proto|schema).rs"
# Expected: These files not included in coverage
```

### TC-4: Specific Component Tests
```rust
// Test Case 4.1: JWT validation test exists
#[test]
fn test_jwt_token_validation() {
    // Expected: Test for valid and invalid tokens
}

// Test Case 4.2: Password hashing test exists
#[test]
fn test_password_hash_and_verify() {
    // Expected: Test for hash generation and verification
}

// Test Case 4.3: Database constraint test exists
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_unique_email_constraint() {
    // Expected: Test for duplicate email rejection
}

// Test Case 4.4: Streaming test exists
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_real_time_task_updates() {
    // Expected: Test for streaming functionality
}
```

## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Test Structure Verification
1. Navigate to project root
2. Verify test directory structure:
   ```bash
   find tests -type f -name "*.rs" | sort
   ```
3. Confirm organization matches requirements
4. Check for common utilities in `tests/common/`

### Step 2: Unit Test Verification
1. Run unit tests with output:
   ```bash
   cargo test --lib -- --nocapture
   ```
2. Verify all service methods have tests
3. Check mock usage in unit tests
4. Confirm fast execution times

### Step 3: Integration Test Verification
1. Ensure Docker is running
2. Run integration tests sequentially:
   ```bash
   cargo test --test '*' -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
   ```
3. Monitor container lifecycle
4. Verify database operations
5. Check gRPC endpoint coverage

### Step 4: Coverage Verification
1. Install tarpaulin if needed:
   ```bash
   cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
   ```
2. Generate coverage report:
   ```bash
   cargo tarpaulin --out Html --output-dir target/coverage
   ```
3. Open `target/coverage/tarpaulin-report.html`
4. Verify coverage meets requirements
5. Identify any uncovered critical paths

### Step 5: Test Quality Verification
1. Run tests multiple times to check determinism
2. Run tests in random order:
   ```bash
   cargo test -- --test-threads=1 --shuffle
   ```
3. Check for proper resource cleanup
4. Verify error messages are helpful
