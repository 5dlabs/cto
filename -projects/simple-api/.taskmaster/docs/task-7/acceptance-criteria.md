  - [ ] 404 for unknown routes
  - [ ] 400 for validation errors
  - [ ] Invalid JSON handling
- [ ] **Data Persistence**:
  - [ ] Created todos can be retrieved

## Non-Functional Acceptance Criteria

### Test Quality
- [ ] Tests are independent (no order dependencies)
- [ ] Clear test descriptions
- [ ] Arrange-Act-Assert pattern followed
- [ ] No hardcoded values where inappropriate
- [ ] Proper cleanup after tests

### Performance
- [ ] All tests complete in < 30 seconds
- [ ] Unit tests run in < 10 seconds
- [ ] No memory leaks in tests
- [ ] Efficient test database usage

### Maintainability
- [ ] DRY principle followed

- [ ] No flaky tests
- [ ] Proper async handling
- [ ] Timeouts configured appropriately

## Test Execution Verification

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm test
```
**Expected**: All tests pass, coverage report shows ≥ 90%

### Run Unit Tests Only
```bash
npm run test:unit
```
**Expected**: Unit tests pass quickly without integration tests

### Run Integration Tests Only
```bash
npm run test:integration
```
**Expected**: Integration tests pass with API testing

### View Coverage Report
```bash
npm test
open coverage/index.html
```
**Expected**: Detailed coverage report with ≥ 90% coverage

### Run Tests in Watch Mode
```bash
npm run test:watch
```
**Expected**: Tests re-run on file changes

## Specific Test Cases to Verify

### Model Test Cases
- [ ] Creating todo with 200-character title succeeds
- [ ] Creating todo with 201-character title fails
- [ ] Updating non-existent todo returns null
- [ ] Boolean false stored as 0, retrieved as false
- [ ] Timestamps update on modification

### Controller Test Cases
- [ ] 404 error has TODO_NOT_FOUND code
- [ ] Constraint errors become 400 status
- [ ] Empty update object handled correctly
- [ ] Stats show 0 completion rate for empty database

### Integration Test Cases
- [ ] Invalid todo ID returns proper validation error
- [ ] Empty title in POST returns specific error
- [ ] Pagination works with limit and offset
- [ ] Health check includes uptime

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All functional acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] All non-functional acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Coverage thresholds achieved (90%+)
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] No console errors during tests
- [ ] Coverage report accessible
- [ ] Tests documented and maintainable
- [ ] CI/CD ready test suite

## Common Issues Checklist
- [ ] Mocks properly reset between tests
- [ ] Test database isolated from production
- [ ] Async operations properly awaited
- [ ] Error scenarios thoroughly tested
- [ ] Edge cases covered

## Notes
- Focus on testing behavior, not implementation
- Integration tests should test user scenarios
- Unit tests should be fast and isolated
- Coverage is important but test quality matters more
