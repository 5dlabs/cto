- Performance checklist
- Deployment readiness

### 6. Create Verification Script
Create `scripts/verify.js`:
- Check all required files exist
- Verify project structure
- Display results with checkmarks/crosses
- Exit with appropriate code

### 7. Final Code Review
Perform these checks:
- Remove all console.log statements
- Ensure consistent code style
- Verify error handling

- Project structure is correct
- No debugging code remains
- Security best practices followed
- All files properly formatted
- Verification script passes

## Important Notes
- Use markdown best practices
