		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Express Project and Configure Environment",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Express project initialization into subtasks covering: 1) Project structure and npm setup, 2) Core dependencies installation, 3) Basic Express server implementation, 4) Middleware configuration, and 5) Environment and scripts setup",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple distinct setup steps but each is relatively straightforward. The complexity comes from ensuring proper configuration and middleware ordering rather than complex logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Setup SQLite Database with Models",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide database setup into: 1) SQLite installation and connection setup, 2) Database schema design and migration scripts, 3) User model implementation with CRUD methods, 4) Task model implementation with CRUD methods, 5) Database initialization and table creation, 6) Seed data implementation",
			"reasoning": "Database setup requires careful schema design, proper SQL query construction, and implementing multiple CRUD operations across two models. The foreign key relationships and prepared statements add complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement JWT Authentication System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split authentication into: 1) JWT utility functions and token generation, 2) Password hashing implementation with bcrypt, 3) Authentication middleware development, 4) User registration endpoint with validation, 5) Login endpoint implementation, 6) Error handling for auth flows, 7) Token refresh mechanism (optional)",
			"reasoning": "Authentication involves security-critical components including proper password hashing, JWT implementation, middleware logic, and multiple error scenarios. Each component requires careful implementation to avoid security vulnerabilities."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Task Management API Endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) GET /tasks endpoint with filtering, 2) POST /tasks with validation, 3) PUT /tasks/:id with ownership verification, 4) DELETE /tasks/:id implementation, 5) Pagination support for GET endpoint, 6) Input validation middleware integration",
			"reasoning": "While CRUD operations are standard, the task requires implementing authorization checks, pagination, validation, and proper HTTP status codes across multiple endpoints, each with its own business logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Add Request Validation and Error Handling",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into: 1) Express-validator setup and validation rules definition, 2) Reusable validation middleware creation, 3) Custom error classes and error handler implementation, 4) Rate limiting configuration, 5) Error logging and response formatting",
			"reasoning": "This task focuses on cross-cutting concerns that touch all endpoints. While conceptually straightforward, it requires consistent implementation across the application and careful consideration of error scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Basic Frontend Interface",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide frontend into: 1) HTML structure and basic layout, 2) CSS styling and responsive design, 3) Authentication forms and JWT handling, 4) Task list display and management UI, 5) API integration with fetch, 6) Error handling and loading states",
			"reasoning": "Building a complete SPA with vanilla JavaScript requires implementing state management, API calls, and DOM manipulation without framework assistance. Multiple UI components need to work together cohesively."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Testing Suite",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure testing into: 1) Jest and testing environment setup, 2) Unit tests for models and database operations, 3) Authentication and JWT utility tests, 4) API endpoint integration tests, 5) Error scenario and edge case testing, 6) Test data factories and utilities, 7) CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive testing requires setting up test infrastructure, writing tests for different layers of the application, handling async operations, mocking dependencies, and ensuring proper test isolation. The 80% coverage target adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Prepare Deployment Configuration and Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) README.md with project documentation, 2) Dockerfile creation with multi-stage build, 3) Docker-compose configuration, 4) API documentation with Swagger, 5) Deployment scripts and health checks, 6) Contributing guidelines and code standards, 7) Backup and maintenance procedures",
			"reasoning": "This task encompasses multiple documentation types, containerization, deployment configurations, and operational procedures. Each component requires different expertise and careful attention to detail for production readiness."
