# Basic Express Testing Application - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Create a simple Express.js web application for testing purposes. This will serve as a foundation for testing our development workflow and platform capabilities.

## Objectives
- Build a minimal but functional Express.js application
- Implement basic CRUD operations
- Add simple authentication
- Test deployment and CI/CD workflows
- Serve as a reference implementation for other projects

## Technical Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Express Server Setup**
   - Basic Express.js server with proper middleware
   - Environment configuration (development/production)
   - Error handling middleware
   - Request logging
   - CORS configuration

2. **Database Integration**
   - SQLite database for simplicity (easy to test)
   - Basic user model
   - Simple task/todo model for CRUD operations
   - Database initialization and seeding

3. **Authentication System**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - User registration endpoint
   - User login endpoint
   - Protected routes middleware
   - Password hashing with bcrypt

4. **API Endpoints**
   - GET /health - Health check endpoint
   - POST /auth/register - User registration
   - POST /auth/login - User login
   - GET /api/tasks - List user's tasks (protected)
   - POST /api/tasks - Create new task (protected)
   - PUT /api/tasks/:id - Update task (protected)
   - DELETE /api/tasks/:id - Delete task (protected)

5. **Basic Frontend (Optional)**
   - Simple HTML form for registration/login
   - Basic task management interface
   - Static file serving

## Technical Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: SQLite with sqlite3 driver
- **Authentication**: JWT + bcrypt
- **Testing**: Jest (for unit tests)
- **Environment**: dotenv for configuration

## Success Criteria
- Server starts successfully on configured port
- Database connection and initialization works
- All API endpoints respond correctly
- Authentication flow works end-to-end
- Basic tests pass
- Can be deployed to our platform

## Non-Requirements
- Complex UI/UX design
- Advanced authorization (roles/permissions)
- Email verification
- Password reset functionality
- Advanced error logging
- Performance optimization
- Extensive validation

## Timeline
This is a testing project, so aim for rapid development:
- Phase 1: Basic server and database setup
- Phase 2: Authentication implementation
- Phase 3: CRUD API endpoints
- Phase 4: Basic testing and deployment

## Notes
- Keep it simple - this is for testing our development workflow
- Focus on getting a working application quickly
- Use well-established patterns and libraries
- Document setup and deployment steps
