      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Infrastructure with PostgreSQL and Redis/Valkey",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the infrastructure setup into discrete deployment steps: namespace and operator setup, database cluster deployment, cache deployment, and configuration management. Each subtask should be independently testable and deployable.",
      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to Kubernetes operator deployments and service configuration. Requires knowledge of CloudNative-PG and Redis operators, but follows standard patterns. Risk comes from operator compatibility and networking configuration."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Notification Service Backend (Rust/Axum)",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the backend implementation into logical layers: project setup and dependencies, data models and database schema, database layer implementation, caching layer, API endpoints and middleware, and logging/monitoring setup. Focus on separation of concerns and testability.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple integrations (PostgreSQL, Redis, rate limiting), async Rust programming, and comprehensive API design. Requires expertise in Rust ecosystem, database design, and API best practices. Testing async code and integration points adds complexity."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Build Web Console Frontend (Next.js/React)",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Structure the frontend development into: project initialization and tooling setup, component library and design system implementation, page layouts and routing, state management and data fetching setup, and theme/accessibility features. Ensure each subtask delivers working UI components.",
      "reasoning": "Moderately high complexity due to modern React patterns, multiple UI libraries integration, and real-time features. Requires expertise in Next.js App Router, state management, and responsive design. Theme switching and real-time polling add technical challenges."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement API Integration and State Management",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Organize API integration work into: API client configuration and error handling, TanStack Query setup and hooks implementation, optimistic updates and cache management, and form validation and user experience enhancements. Each subtask should improve the user experience incrementally.",
      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity focused on integration patterns and user experience. Requires understanding of client-server communication, caching strategies, and error handling. Optimistic updates and proper error boundaries require careful state management."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "End-to-End Testing and Performance Optimization",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Structure testing and optimization into: E2E test framework setup, comprehensive test suite implementation, backend performance optimization (database and caching), frontend performance optimization, load testing and benchmarking, and monitoring/documentation setup. Each subtask should include measurable performance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "Very high complexity due to comprehensive testing requirements, performance optimization across the full stack, and specific performance targets. Requires expertise in testing frameworks, database optimization, caching strategies, and performance monitoring. Load testing and meeting specific SLA requirements adds significant complexity."
