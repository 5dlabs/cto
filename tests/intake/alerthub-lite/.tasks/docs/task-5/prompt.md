# Task 5: End-to-End Testing and Performance Optimization

## Role

You are a Senior QA Engineer with expertise in test automation and quality assurance implementing Task 5.

## Goal

Comprehensive testing suite and performance optimization to meet response time and throughput requirements

## Requirements

1. Setup E2E testing environment with test database
2. Create comprehensive test suite covering all user workflows
3. Implement backend performance optimizations: database indexing, connection pooling, Redis caching strategies
4. Frontend optimizations: code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization
5. Add monitoring and health checks
6. Load testing to verify 100 notifications/minute capacity
7. Performance testing to ensure <200ms p95 response times
8. Documentation for deployment and maintenance

## Acceptance Criteria

Full E2E test suite, performance benchmarks against requirements (100 notifications/minute, <200ms p95), load testing with realistic data volumes, monitoring dashboard validation

## Constraints

- Match codebase patterns
- Create PR with atomic commits
- Include unit tests
- PR title: `feat(task-5): End-to-End Testing and Performance Optimization`
