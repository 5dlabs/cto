# Test Scenarios

This directory contains realistic test scenarios for each agent type.
Each scenario represents a typical task that agent would handle in production.

## Scenario Files

Each YAML file defines:
- **Task description**: What the agent should do
- **Repository context**: Type of codebase they're working on
- **Expected tools**: Which MCP tools they'd likely use
- **Success criteria**: How we know the task completed successfully
