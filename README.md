# 5D Labs Agent Platform

An AI-powered development platform that helps you generate documentation and implement code using Claude agents through simple MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools.

## What It Does

The platform provides two main capabilities:
- **üìù Documentation Generation**: Automatically creates comprehensive documentation for your Task Master projects
- **‚ö° Code Implementation**: Deploys autonomous Claude agents to implement specific tasks from your project

Both operations run as Kubernetes jobs and automatically submit results via GitHub PRs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Access to a Cursor/Claude environment with MCP support
- A project with Task Master initialized (`.taskmaster/` directory)
- GitHub repository for your project

## Installation

This is an integrated platform that consists of:
- **Orchestrator**: Kubernetes service that manages Claude agents
- **MCP Tools**: CLI interface for docs/task commands
- **Agent Management**: Automated deployment and workspace isolation

All components work together - the MCP tools communicate with the orchestrator service to deploy and manage Claude agents.

### Deploy the Complete Platform

```bash
# Add the 5dlabs Helm repository
helm repo add 5dlabs https://5dlabs.github.io/platform
helm repo update

# Install Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) first
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/5dlabs/platform/releases/download/v0.0.2/platform-crds.yaml

# Install the orchestrator
helm install orchestrator 5dlabs/orchestrator --namespace orchestrator --create-namespace

# Setup agent secrets (interactive)
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5dlabs/platform/main/infra/scripts/setup-agent-secrets.sh
chmod +x setup-agent-secrets.sh
./setup-agent-secrets.sh --help
```

**Requirements:**
- Kubernetes 1.19+
- Helm 3.2.0+
- GitHub Personal Access Token
- Anthropic API Key

**What you get:**
- Complete orchestrator platform deployed to Kubernetes
- REST API for task management
- Custom Kubernetes operators for CodeRun/DocsRun resources
- Agent workspace management and isolation
- MCP tools that connect to your deployment

### Building from Source (Development)

```bash
# Build from source
git clone https://github.com/5dlabs/platform.git
cd platform/orchestrator

# Build the tools binary (contains both CLI and MCP server)
cargo build --release --bin fivedlabs-tools

# The binary includes both tools:
./target/release/fivedlabs-tools --help          # CLI tool (5d-cli)
./target/release/fivedlabs-tools --mcp --help    # MCP server (5d-mcp)

# Install to your system (optional)
cp target/release/fivedlabs-tools /usr/local/bin/
```

### MCP Tools Available

The platform exposes two primary MCP tools:

#### 1. `docs` - Generate Documentation
Analyzes your Task Master project and creates comprehensive documentation.

```javascript
docs({
  working_directory: "_projects/my-app",
  model: "claude-opus-4-20250514",
  repository_url: "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo",
  source_branch: "main",
  github_user: "your-github-username"
});
```

**What happens:**
‚úÖ Creates a Claude agent with your project context
‚úÖ Analyzes all tasks in your Task Master project
‚úÖ Generates comprehensive documentation
‚úÖ Submits a GitHub PR with the docs

**Generated Documents:**
```
.taskmaster/docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-1/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task.md           # Comprehensive task documentation
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ acceptance-criteria.md  # Clear success criteria
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prompt.md         # Implementation guidance for agents
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-2/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ acceptance-criteria.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prompt.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

#### 2. `task` - Implement Code
Deploys an autonomous Claude agent to implement a specific task from your Task Master project.

```javascript
// Implement a specific task (initial implementation)
task({
  task_id: 5,
  service: "api-server",
  repository_url: "https://github.com/myorg/my-api",
  github_user: "myusername",
  working_directory: "_projects/my-api"
});

// Continue working on a partially completed or failed task
task({
  task_id: 5,
  service: "api-server",
  repository_url: "https://github.com/myorg/my-api",
  github_user: "myusername",
  working_directory: "_projects/my-api",
  continue_session: true,
  context_version: 2
});
```

**What happens:**
‚úÖ Creates a Claude agent with the generated docs as context
‚úÖ Loads the specific task details from Task Master
‚úÖ Implements the code autonomously
‚úÖ Runs tests and validation
‚úÖ Submits a GitHub PR with the implementation

## Best Practices

1. **Always generate docs first** to establish baseline documentation
2. **Implement tasks sequentially** based on dependencies
3. **Use `continue_session: true`** for retries on the same task
4. **Review GitHub PRs promptly** - agents provide detailed logs and explanations
5. **Check PR descriptions** for detailed agent logs when troubleshooting

## Support

- Check GitHub PRs for detailed agent logs and explanations
- Review Task Master project structure in `.taskmaster/` directory
- Verify repository access and GitHub authentication setup
