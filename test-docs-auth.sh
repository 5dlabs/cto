# Test script for docs authentication fixes - minimal credit usage

echo "=== Testing Docs Authentication Fixes ==="

# Test 1: Quick docs generation with immediate PR
echo "Test 1: Quick single task documentation (< 1 minute)"
echo "This tests basic auth and PR creation works"

# Test 2: Delayed PR creation (simulates long-running task)
echo "Test 2: Generate docs, wait 65 minutes, then create PR"
echo "This tests token refresh on PR creation"

# Test 3: Hook functionality
echo "Test 3: Generate 2-3 tasks with pauses between"
echo "This tests auto-save hook triggers correctly"

# Suggested test project structure:
cat > test-prd.txt << 'EOF'
# Simple Test Project

A minimal project to test documentation generation.

## Requirements
1. Create a hello world endpoint
2. Add basic error handling
3. Include a health check

Keep it simple - this is just for testing auth.

echo "Run tests in this order:"
echo "1. Quick test with 1 task - verify basic flow works"
echo "2. If #1 works, test with artificial delay to test token refresh"
echo "3. If #2 works, test with multiple tasks to verify auto-save"
