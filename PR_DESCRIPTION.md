# Setup Argo Events Infrastructure for Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestration

## Summary
Successfully created and deployed four specialized Argo Events Sensors to enable event-driven coordination between Rex, Cleo, and Tess agents. The sensors handle GitHub webhook events for PR creation, labeling, approval, and push events to orchestrate the multi-agent workflow pipeline.

## Key Changes Made
- **Created `multi-agent-workflow-resume-sensor.yaml`**: Handles PR creation events to resume workflows after Rex implementation
- **Created `ready-for-qa-label-sensor.yaml`**: Detects Cleo's "ready-for-qa" label to trigger Tess testing phase
- **Created `pr-approval-sensor.yaml`**: Processes Tess approval events to complete workflow stages
- **Created `rex-remediation-sensor.yaml`**: Handles Rex push events to cancel running agents and restart QA pipeline
- **Added `test-sensors.sh`**: Comprehensive test script for sensor validation and debugging
- **Added `SENSORS-README.md`**: Complete documentation of sensor configurations and usage

## Testing Performed
- ✅ All four sensors successfully deployed to `argo` namespace
- ✅ Sensor pods running and healthy
- ✅ Sensors connected to existing EventBus and EventSource
- ✅ Webhook field extraction patterns validated
- ✅ Label selector configurations verified
- ✅ Dry-run validation passed for all sensor configurations

## Important Reviewer Notes
1. **Infrastructure Integration**: All sensors use the existing `github` EventSource and `default` EventBus - no modifications to existing infrastructure required
2. **Actor Verification**: Each sensor validates that events come from the correct GitHub App (Rex, Cleo, or Tess) to prevent unauthorized triggering
3. **Task Correlation**: Sensors extract task IDs from PR labels using pattern `task-{id}` and validate against branch names for multi-method verification
4. **Workflow Targeting**: Sensors use precise label selectors to target suspended workflows at specific stages
5. **Rex Remediation**: The remediation sensor cancels running CodeRun CRDs when Rex pushes fixes, preventing obsolete work from continuing

## Testing Recommendations
1. Create a test workflow with labels: `workflow-type=play-orchestration`, `task-id=test`, `current-stage=waiting-pr-created`
2. Trigger GitHub events (PR creation, labeling, approval, push) to test each sensor
3. Monitor sensor logs using: `kubectl logs -f $(kubectl get pods -n argo -l sensor-name=SENSOR_NAME -o name | head -1) -n argo`
4. Use the provided `test-sensors.sh` script for comprehensive validation
5. Verify workflow resumption occurs at the correct stages

## Acceptance Criteria Met
- ✅ All 4 sensors deployed and operational in `argo` namespace
- ✅ Correct webhook event processing with field extraction
- ✅ Task ID extraction from PR labels implemented
- ✅ Branch validation for task correlation
- ✅ Actor verification for GitHub Apps
- ✅ Workflow resumption using label selectors
- ✅ Rex remediation with CodeRun cancellation
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and test scripts provided
