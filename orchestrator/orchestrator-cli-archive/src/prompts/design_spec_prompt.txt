Generate a design-spec.md that covers:
1. Technical architecture for this component
2. Data models and structures
3. API contracts (if applicable)
4. File structure and organization
5. Integration points with other components
6. Technology choices and rationale
7. Performance and security considerations

Structure the document as follows:
- Overview
- Architecture
  - Technology stack
  - Component diagram (if relevant)
  - Data flow
- Implementation Details
  - Core modules/classes
  - Data models
  - API specifications
  - File organization
- Integration
  - Dependencies
  - External interfaces
  - Configuration requirements
- Non-functional Requirements
  - Performance considerations
  - Security considerations
  - Scalability

Focus on providing clear technical guidance for implementation. Be specific about design decisions and their rationale.
