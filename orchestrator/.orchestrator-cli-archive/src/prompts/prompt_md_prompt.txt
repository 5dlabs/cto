Generate a prompt.md with step-by-step implementation instructions that:
1. Provides exact commands to run for each subtask
2. Includes code examples and boilerplate where helpful
3. Explains common pitfalls and how to avoid them
4. Shows how to verify each step is completed correctly
5. Integrates with Task Master commands (task-master set-status, next, etc.)
6. Concludes with instructions for creating a pull request

Structure the document as follows:
- Brief introduction
- Prerequisites/setup requirements
- Step-by-step instructions for each subtask
- Verification steps after each major milestone
- Git workflow instructions
- Final steps including PR creation

The target audience is an AI agent (Claude) that will implement these instructions autonomously. Be specific, include exact commands, and provide clear success criteria for each step.
