# CTO Platform-in-a-Box: Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The CTO Platform-in-a-Box is a productized, distributable version of the 5D Labs CTO
platform delivered as a bootable ISO image. It enables organizations to deploy a complete
cloud-native development platform on bare-metal hardware with minimal technical expertise.

**Vision**: "Engineering team infrastructure on a USB key"

**Target Users**: Development teams and small-to-medium organizations who want on-premises
cloud infrastructure without dedicated DevOps staff.

---

## Problem Statement

Organizations face significant challenges deploying modern cloud-native infrastructure:

1. **Complexity**: Kubernetes, GitOps, secrets management, observability - each requires
   deep expertise to deploy and maintain correctly.

2. **Cloud Costs**: Public cloud costs escalate quickly, especially for compute-intensive
   workloads. Many organizations have underutilized on-premises hardware.

3. **Compliance**: Some industries require on-premises data processing and cannot use
   public cloud services.

4. **DevOps Scarcity**: Skilled infrastructure engineers are expensive and hard to find.
   Small teams often lack the expertise to build reliable platforms.

---

## Solution

A productized platform delivered through multiple tiers to serve different customer segments:

### Tier 1: CTO Appliance (MVP)
A bootable ISO that installs a complete, production-ready platform on bare-metal servers:

- Boot from USB/ISO
- Follow simple setup wizard (5-10 minutes)
- Platform installs and configures automatically (15-30 minutes)
- Access dashboard and start deploying applications
- **No Kubernetes knowledge required**

### Tier 2: CTO Enterprise (Post-MVP)
Scalable multi-node clusters for growing organizations:

- Start with Appliance, scale to enterprise
- Add nodes via simple enrollment process
- High availability control plane
- Distributed storage across nodes
- Enterprise support and SLAs

### Tier 3: CTO Platform (Post-MVP)
Helm charts and operators for teams with existing Kubernetes:

- Bring your own Kubernetes (any distribution)
- Install CTO platform components only
- Full GitOps integration
- For DevOps-savvy teams
- Lower price point (no infrastructure management)
