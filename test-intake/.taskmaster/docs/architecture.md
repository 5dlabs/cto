# System Architecture Document

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level architecture for our project, providing a comprehensive view of the system's structure, components, and interactions.

## System Context

### External Interfaces
- **User Interface**: Web-based dashboard for system management
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs for programmatic access
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent data storage
- **External Services**: Integration points with third-party services
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 / JWT-based user authentication

### System Boundaries
The system operates as a standalone service with clear boundaries:
- Data ingress through defined API endpoints
- Data processing within the system's domain logic
- Data egress through structured response formats
- External dependencies clearly isolated through adapter patterns

## Architecture Components

- Configuration panels
- Real-time notification system

### 2. API Gateway Layer
**Technology Stack**: Node.js with Express.js
**Responsibilities**:
- Request routing and load balancing
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and security
- Request/response transformation
- API versioning

### 3. Business Logic Layer
**Technology Stack**: Python with FastAPI
**Responsibilities**:
- Domain logic implementation
- Business rules enforcement
- Data validation and transformation
- Workflow orchestration
- Error handling and logging

**Core Services**:
- User Management Service
- Data Processing Service

- Analytics Service

### 4. Data Layer
**Technology Stack**: PostgreSQL with Redis
**Responsibilities**:
- Data persistence and retrieval
- Data consistency and integrity
- Caching for performance optimization
- Backup and disaster recovery

**Data Models**:
- User profiles and authentication data
- System configuration and settings
- Operational logs and audit trails
- Performance metrics and analytics

## Data Flow Architecture

### Request Flow
```
User Request → API Gateway → Authentication → Business Logic → Data Layer → Response
```

### Data Processing Flow
```
Input Data → Validation → Processing → Storage → Notification → Response
```

### Error Handling Flow
```
Error Detection → Logging → User Notification → Recovery → Monitoring Alert
```

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** for API access
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC) for permissions
- **OAuth 2.0 integration** for third-party logins
- **Session management** with secure token handling

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at rest** for sensitive data
- **TLS 1.3** for data in transit
- **API key management** for service authentication
- **Audit logging** for compliance tracking

## Scalability & Performance

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Load balancing** across multiple instances
- **Database connection pooling**
- **Redis clustering** for caching
- **CDN integration** for static assets

### Performance Optimization
- **Database indexing** for query optimization
- **Caching strategies** for frequently accessed data
- **Asynchronous processing** for background tasks
- **Monitoring and alerting** for performance metrics

## Deployment Architecture

### Containerization
- **Docker containers** for consistent deployment
- **Kubernetes orchestration** for scalability
- **Helm charts** for configuration management
- **ArgoCD** for GitOps deployment

### Environment Strategy
- **Development**: Local development with hot reload
- **Staging**: Full system testing environment
- **Production**: High-availability production cluster

## Monitoring & Observability

### Logging Strategy
- **Structured logging** with correlation IDs
- **Centralized log aggregation** (ELK stack)
- **Log retention policies** based on compliance
- **Real-time log analysis** for troubleshooting

### Metrics & Monitoring
- **Application metrics** (response times, error rates)
- **System metrics** (CPU, memory, disk usage)
- **Business metrics** (user activity, feature usage)
- **Custom dashboards** for operational visibility

### Alerting
- **Automated alerts** for critical issues
- **Escalation policies** for different severity levels
- **On-call rotation** for 24/7 coverage
- **Incident response** procedures
