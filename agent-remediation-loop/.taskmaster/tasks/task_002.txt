# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Feedback Comment Parser
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Build robust parsing system to extract structured feedback from PR comments with 'ðŸ”´ Required Changes' format
# Details:
Create a comment parsing module that extracts structured feedback data from Tess QA comments. Implementation in Rust/Go:

1. Define data structures for feedback (IssueType, Severity, etc.)
2. Implement regex patterns for extracting metadata
3. Parse markdown checkboxes for acceptance criteria
4. Handle edge cases and malformed comments
5. Validate author authorization (must be Tess or approved reviewer)

Key components:
- Regex patterns for Issue Type/Severity extraction
- Markdown parser for structured sections
- Error handling with fallback to manual review

Pseudo-code:
```rust
pub fn parse_feedback(comment: &str) -> Result<StructuredFeedback> {
    if !comment.contains("ðŸ”´ Required Changes") {
        return Err("Not actionable feedback");
    }
    
    let issue_type = extract_pattern(r"Issue Type.*\[(.*?)\]");
    let severity = extract_pattern(r"Severity.*\[(.*?)\]");
    let criteria = extract_checkboxes(comment);
    
    Ok(StructuredFeedback {
        issue_type: parse_issue_type(issue_type)?,
        severity: parse_severity(severity)?,
        criteria_not_met: criteria,
        // ... other fields
    })
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests with various comment formats (valid and invalid)
2. Test edge cases: missing fields, special characters, long descriptions
3. Performance tests with large comments
4. Integration tests with actual GitHub comment payloads
5. Security tests for injection attacks in comment content

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Data Structures and Enums [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive data structures and enums for representing structured feedback components
### Details:
Define Rust/Go structs for StructuredFeedback, IssueType enum (security, performance, quality, etc.), Severity enum (critical, high, medium, low), CriteriaStatus, and FeedbackMetadata. Include fields for author validation, timestamps, PR context, and nested structures for complex feedback scenarios. Ensure proper serialization/deserialization support for JSON and implement Display traits for logging.

## 2. Implement Regex Pattern Extraction [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Build regex-based metadata extraction system for parsing Issue Type, Severity, and other structured fields
### Details:
Create a regex pattern library with patterns for extracting Issue Type (r"Issue Type.*\[(.*?)\]"), Severity (r"Severity.*\[(.*?)\]"), affected files, line numbers, and custom metadata fields. Implement extract_pattern() function with proper error handling, support for multiline matching, and fallback strategies for variations in formatting. Include performance optimizations using compiled regex patterns.

## 3. Build Markdown Checkbox Parser [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement parser for extracting and analyzing markdown checkboxes from acceptance criteria sections
### Details:
Create extract_checkboxes() function to parse markdown checkbox syntax (- [ ] and - [x]), maintain checkbox state and associated text, handle nested lists and indentation, and support various markdown flavors. Return structured data mapping criteria descriptions to their completion status. Handle edge cases like escaped characters, code blocks containing checkboxes, and malformed markdown.

## 4. Add Author Validation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement authorization system to validate comment authors against approved reviewer list
### Details:
Build validate_author() function checking if comment author is Tess QA bot or in approved reviewer allowlist. Implement configurable allowlist management, support for team-based permissions, and integration with GitHub API for user verification. Add special handling for bot accounts, service accounts, and admin overrides. Include caching mechanism for authorization results to reduce API calls.

## 5. Implement Error Handling and Fallbacks [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Create comprehensive error handling system with graceful degradation and manual review fallbacks
### Details:
Design error types for parsing failures (MalformedComment, MissingRequiredField, InvalidAuthor), implement Result<StructuredFeedback, ParseError> return types, create fallback parsing strategies for partial extraction, and add logging with context for debugging. Implement retry logic for transient failures, queue malformed comments for manual review, and provide detailed error messages for operators.

## 6. Create Comprehensive Unit Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5
### Description: Develop extensive test suite covering all parsing scenarios, edge cases, and security considerations
### Details:
Write unit tests for valid comment parsing with all field combinations, malformed comments with missing/invalid fields, edge cases (empty comments, special characters, Unicode), performance tests with large comments (>10MB), security tests for injection attacks (XSS, command injection), regex performance and catastrophic backtracking prevention, and integration tests with real GitHub webhook payloads. Include property-based testing for fuzzing input validation.
