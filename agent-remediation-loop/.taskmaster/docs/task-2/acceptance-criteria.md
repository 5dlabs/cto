# Task 2: Acceptance Criteria - Implement Feedback Comment Parser

## Core Functionality

### âœ… Data Structure Implementation
- [ ] `StructuredFeedback` struct contains all required fields: issue_type, severity, description, criteria_not_met, reproduction_steps, expected_behavior, actual_behavior, metadata
- [ ] `IssueType` enum supports: Bug, MissingFeature, Regression, Performance
- [ ] `Severity` enum supports: Critical, High, Medium, Low with proper ordering (Critical > High > Medium > Low)
- [ ] `CriteriaStatus` struct tracks checkbox description, completion state, and line number
- [ ] `FeedbackMetadata` includes author, timestamp, comment_id, pr_number, task_id
- [ ] All structs implement `serde::Serialize` and `serde::Deserialize`
- [ ] All enums implement `Display` trait with correct string representations
- [ ] All types are properly documented with rustdoc comments

### âœ… Pattern Extraction System
- [ ] Regex patterns extract Issue Type from `**Issue Type**: [value]` format
- [ ] Regex patterns extract Severity from `**Severity**: [value]` format  
- [ ] Description extraction from `### Description` section works correctly
- [ ] Steps to Reproduce extraction handles numbered lists (1. 2. 3.)
- [ ] Expected vs Actual extraction works with `**Expected**: value` format
- [ ] All regex patterns are compiled using `lazy_static` for performance
- [ ] Regex patterns handle multiline content and whitespace variations
- [ ] Patterns prevent catastrophic backtracking with proper bounds

### âœ… Markdown Checkbox Parser
- [ ] Extracts checkboxes from "Acceptance Criteria Not Met" section
- [ ] Correctly parses `- [ ]` as uncompleted criteria
- [ ] Correctly parses `- [x]` as completed criteria  
- [ ] Handles nested lists and indentation properly
- [ ] Ignores checkboxes in code blocks or other sections
- [ ] Maintains line number information for each checkbox
- [ ] Returns empty list gracefully when no checkboxes found
- [ ] Handles malformed checkbox syntax without crashing

### âœ… Author Validation
- [ ] Validates "5DLabs-Tess" as authorized QA bot
- [ ] Supports configurable allowlist of approved reviewers
- [ ] Implements caching mechanism with 5-minute TTL using `DashMap`
- [ ] Rejects comments from unauthorized authors with clear error
- [ ] Supports dynamic addition/removal of approved authors
- [ ] Handles team-based permissions (e.g., users starting with "5DLabs-")
- [ ] Clears cache when needed for security updates
- [ ] Gracefully handles network failures for team membership checks

## Error Handling & Resilience

### âœ… Error Types and Handling
- [ ] Custom `ParseError` enum covers all failure modes using `thiserror`
- [ ] `NotActionableFeedback` error when missing "ðŸ”´ Required Changes"
- [ ] `UnauthorizedAuthor` error with author name in message
- [ ] `MissingRequiredField` error specifies which field is missing
- [ ] `InvalidFieldValue` error shows field name and invalid value
- [ ] `MalformedComment` error provides helpful debugging context
- [ ] All errors implement proper `Display` and `Debug` traits
- [ ] Errors chain properly using `anyhow::Context` for debugging

### âœ… Graceful Degradation
- [ ] Parser continues when optional fields are missing
- [ ] Partial extraction works when some sections are malformed
- [ ] Invalid enum values fall back to reasonable defaults or errors
- [ ] Large comments are processed without memory issues
- [ ] Special characters and Unicode don't break parsing
- [ ] Nested markdown structures are handled correctly
- [ ] Empty sections don't cause parser to fail

## Performance & Security

### âœ… Performance Requirements
- [ ] Typical comments (1-10KB) parse in under 10ms
- [ ] Large comments (1MB+) parse in under 100ms
- [ ] Regex patterns don't exhibit catastrophic backtracking
- [ ] Author validation cache reduces API calls effectively
- [ ] Memory usage stays bounded for very large inputs
- [ ] Concurrent parsing operations don't interfere

### âœ… Security Validation
- [ ] XSS prevention: HTML/script tags in comments don't execute
- [ ] Command injection prevention: Shell metacharacters are safe
- [ ] ReDoS prevention: Regex patterns have complexity bounds
- [ ] Path traversal prevention: No file system access from comment data
- [ ] Memory exhaustion prevention: Large inputs don't cause OOM
- [ ] Authorization bypass prevention: Cache poisoning not possible

## Integration & API

### âœ… Module Organization
- [ ] `controller/src/remediation/mod.rs` properly exports public API
- [ ] Public function `parse_feedback_comment()` works as documented
- [ ] Module integrates with existing controller patterns
- [ ] Types are compatible with JSON serialization for API responses
- [ ] Module follows Rust naming conventions and best practices
- [ ] Documentation is complete with usage examples

### âœ… Rex Container Integration
- [ ] Parser can be called from Rex container in remediation mode
- [ ] Integration works through controller library linkage
- [ ] Parser results can be serialized for HTTP API responses
- [ ] Error handling integrates with controller error patterns
- [ ] Logging output uses `tracing` crate consistently
- [ ] Configuration can be loaded from controller config system

## Testing Coverage

### âœ… Unit Tests
- [ ] Valid comment parsing tests for all field combinations
- [ ] Issue Type extraction tests for all enum variants
- [ ] Severity extraction tests for all levels
- [ ] Description extraction handles multiline content
- [ ] Checkbox parsing tests for various markdown formats
- [ ] Author validation tests for authorized/unauthorized users
