# Task 2: Implement Feedback Comment Parser

You are an autonomous AI agent tasked with implementing a robust Rust-based feedback comment parser for the Agent Remediation Loop system. This parser extracts structured data from QA feedback comments to enable automated remediation.

## Objective

Build a complete parsing module in `controller/src/remediation/` that can:

1. Parse structured feedback from PR comments with "ðŸ”´ Required Changes" format
2. Extract Issue Type, Severity, descriptions, and acceptance criteria checkboxes
3. Validate comment authors against an approved list
4. Handle errors gracefully with fallbacks for manual review
5. Integrate seamlessly with the existing controller architecture

## Required Deliverables

### Core Module Files

1. **`controller/src/remediation/types.rs`**
   - `StructuredFeedback` struct with all feedback components
   - `IssueType` enum: Bug, MissingFeature, Regression, Performance
   - `Severity` enum: Critical, High, Medium, Low (with ordering)
   - `CriteriaStatus` struct for checkbox state and description
   - `FeedbackMetadata` struct for author, timestamp, PR context
   - Implement `Display` traits and serde serialization

2. **`controller/src/remediation/patterns.rs`**
   - `PatternExtractor` struct with lazy-compiled regex patterns
   - Extract Issue Type: `r"(?m)^\s*\*\*Issue Type\*\*:\s*\[(.*?)\]"`
   - Extract Severity: `r"(?m)^\s*\*\*Severity\*\*:\s*\[(.*?)\]"`
   - Extract Description, Steps to Reproduce, Expected/Actual behavior
   - Optimize regex patterns to prevent catastrophic backtracking

3. **`controller/src/remediation/markdown.rs`**
   - `MarkdownParser` struct for checkbox extraction
   - Parse "Acceptance Criteria Not Met" section
   - Extract markdown checkboxes: `- [ ]` (uncompleted) and `- [x]` (completed)
   - Handle nested lists, indentation, and malformed markdown
   - Consider using `pulldown-cmark` crate for robust parsing

4. **`controller/src/remediation/auth.rs`**
   - `AuthorValidator` struct with configurable allowlist
   - Validate "5DLabs-Tess" and other approved reviewers
   - Implement caching with `DashMap` for performance (5-minute TTL)
   - Support team-based permissions and admin overrides
   - Add/remove approved authors dynamically

5. **`controller/src/remediation/parser.rs`**
   - `FeedbackParser` main struct orchestrating all components
   - `parse_comment()` method returning `Result<StructuredFeedback>`
   - Check for "ðŸ”´ Required Changes" marker to identify actionable feedback
   - Graceful error handling with detailed context using `anyhow`
   - Integration point for Rex container usage

6. **`controller/src/remediation/error.rs`**
   - Custom error types using `thiserror` crate
   - `ParseError` enum covering all failure modes
   - `NotActionableFeedback`, `UnauthorizedAuthor`, `MissingRequiredField`, etc.
   - Structured error context for debugging and monitoring

7. **`controller/src/remediation/mod.rs`**
   - Public API exports and re-exports
   - Convenience function `parse_feedback_comment()` for external use
   - Module organization and documentation

### Test Suite

Create comprehensive tests in `controller/src/remediation/tests/`:

1. **Unit Tests** - Each module with positive/negative test cases
2. **Integration Tests** - Full parsing workflow with real comment examples
3. **Edge Case Tests** - Malformed comments, special characters, large inputs
4. **Performance Tests** - Large comments, regex optimization validation
5. **Security Tests** - XSS prevention, injection attack resistance
6. **Property-Based Tests** - Using `proptest` for fuzzing validation

### Expected Comment Format

The parser must handle this structured feedback format:

```markdown
ðŸ”´ Required Changes
**Issue Type**: [Bug|Missing Feature|Regression|Performance]
**Severity**: [Critical|High|Medium|Low]

### Description
[Clear description of the issue]

### Acceptance Criteria Not Met
- [ ] Specific criterion not satisfied
- [ ] Another missing requirement
- [x] This criterion was already met

### Steps to Reproduce (optional)
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

### Expected vs Actual (optional)
- **Expected**: [what should happen]
- **Actual**: [what actually happens]
```

## Implementation Requirements

### Rust Best Practices

- Use `anyhow::Result` for error propagation with context
- Implement `lazy_static` for regex compilation optimization  
- Use `serde` for JSON serialization/deserialization
- Follow existing patterns from `controller/src/tasks/`
- Add comprehensive documentation and examples
- Include integration with `tracing` for structured logging

### Performance Considerations

- Compile regex patterns once using `lazy_static`
- Implement author validation caching with reasonable TTL
- Handle large comments efficiently (test with >10MB inputs)
- Prevent regex DoS attacks with bounded matching

### Error Handling Strategy

- Parse what you can, fail gracefully on missing optional fields
- Provide detailed error context for debugging
- Queue malformed comments for manual review
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Log parsing attempts with structured data

### Integration Points

- Design for usage by Rex container in remediation mode
- Compatible with controller API patterns
- Support both library and HTTP API access
- Maintain state isolation between parsing operations

## Validation Criteria

Your implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **Parsing Accuracy**: Correctly extracts all structured data from valid comments
2. **Error Resilience**: Handles malformed input gracefully without crashes
3. **Performance**: Processes large comments within reasonable time limits
4. **Security**: Resists common injection and DoS attack vectors
5. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with controller architecture patterns
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with edge cases and security scenarios
7. **Documentation**: Clear code documentation and usage examples

## Dependencies

Add these dependencies to `controller/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
anyhow = "1.0"
regex = "1.0" 
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }
lazy_static = "1.4"
thiserror = "1.0"
dashmap = "5.4"
pulldown-cmark = "0.9"
tracing = "0.1"

[dev-dependencies]
proptest = "1.0"
tokio-test = "0.4"
```

## Success Metrics

- All unit tests pass with >95% code coverage
- Integration tests work with real GitHub webhook payloads  
- Performance tests complete within 100ms for typical comments
- Security tests pass without vulnerabilities
- Code review passes with no major issues
- Documentation is complete and accurate

Implement this parser as a production-ready Rust module that enables the Agent Remediation Loop to automatically process QA feedback and trigger appropriate remediation actions.
