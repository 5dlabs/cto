## Security Testing Validation

### ✅ Penetration Testing
- [ ] Input validation blocks XSS attempts:
  - `<script>alert('xss')</script>`
  - `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`
  - `javascript:alert('xss')`
- [ ] SQL injection patterns properly sanitized:
  - `'; DROP TABLE users; --`

- [ ] Command injection attempts blocked:
  - `; cat /etc/passwd`
  - `| rm -rf /`
  - `$(malicious_command)`

  - `${7*7}` (should not evaluate to 49)
  - `{{constructor.constructor('alert(1)')()}}`
  - `#{7*7}` (Ruby template injection)

### ✅ Authentication and Authorization Testing
- [ ] Invalid GitHub tokens rejected with proper error messages
