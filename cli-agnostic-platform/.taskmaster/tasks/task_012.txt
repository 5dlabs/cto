Add compliance logging for SOC2 and GDPR requirements. Create chaos engineering tests with Litmus framework. Build SLO monitoring with 99.9% availability target.

# Test Strategy:
Circuit breakers open after threshold failures. Request hedging reduces p99 latency by 30%. Connection pools handle connection failures gracefully. Lazy loading reduces startup time below 5 seconds. Security scans find no critical vulnerabilities. Chaos tests don't cause data loss. SLOs maintained under load testing with 10x normal traffic.
