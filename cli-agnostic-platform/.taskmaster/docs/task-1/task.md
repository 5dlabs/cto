# Task 1: Assess Current CLI-Agnostic Platform Implementation

## Overview
Analyze and document the existing CLI-agnostic platform implementation to understand what capabilities already exist and what still needs to be built. This task provides a clear understanding of the current system architecture and identifies gaps for future development.

## Context
The 5D Labs Agent Platform already has a substantial CLI-agnostic implementation with Rust-based controller, MCP server, and Docker images for multiple CLI tools (Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini, Grok, Qwen, Cursor, OpenHands). This task assesses the current state to guide further development.

## Assessment Areas

### 1. Existing Rust Architecture Analysis
- **Location**: `controller/` directory 
- **Current State**: Examine existing Rust controller implementation
- **Assessment Goals**:
  - Document current CLI integration capabilities
  - Identify which CLI types are supported
  - Analyze CRD definitions and controller logic
  - Review error handling and logging patterns

### 2. MCP Server Implementation Review
- **Location**: `mcp/` directory
- **Current State**: Rust-based MCP server (NO TypeScript)
- **Assessment Goals**:
  - Document current MCP protocol support
  - Identify tool integration capabilities
  - Review client connection handling
  - Analyze performance and scalability

### 3. Container Infrastructure Audit
- **Location**: `infra/images/`
- **Current State**: Multiple CLI Docker images exist
- **Assessment Goals**:
  - Verify which CLI images are functional:
    - `claude/` - Claude Code CLI
    - `codex/` - OpenAI Codex CLI
    - `opencode/` - OpenCode CLI  
    - `gemini/` - Google Gemini CLI
    - `grok/` - Grok CLI
    - `qwen/` - Qwen CLI
    - `cursor/` - Cursor CLI
    - `openhands/` - OpenHands CLI
  - Test build processes and dependencies
  - Document configuration requirements

### 4. GitOps and Deployment Analysis
- **Location**: `infra/gitops/`
- **Current State**: ArgoCD applications exist
- **Assessment Goals**:
  - Review existing ArgoCD application configurations
  - Document current deployment patterns
  - Identify any missing automation

### 5. Build and CI/CD Evaluation
- **Current State**: GitHub Actions workflows exist
- **Assessment Goals**:
  - Review existing automation pipelines
  - Document build processes
  - Identify gaps in testing/deployment

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Architecture Documentation
1. Analyze existing `controller/` Rust implementation
2. Document current CRD definitions and controller capabilities  
3. Map out existing CLI integration patterns
4. Identify supported vs. unsupported CLI types
5. **Use docs MCP server to research CLI functionality**:
   - **Codex Research**: Use `codex_query` for "installation requirements", "configuration patterns", "MCP integration"
   - **OpenCode Research**: Use `opencode_query` for "setup guide", "MCP server support", "agent configuration"
   - **OpenHands Research**: Use `openhands_query` for "CLI usage", "python dependencies", "automation capabilities"
   - **Gemini Research**: Use `gemini_query` for "installation", "authentication", "model configuration"
   - **Qwen Research**: Use `qwen_query` for "setup instructions", "model handling", "API configuration"
   - **Grok Research**: Use `grok_query` for "installation", "X.AI integration", "MCP tools support"
   - Document CLI-specific requirements, authentication patterns, and configuration formats
   - Identify which CLIs support MCP natively vs. need wrapper integration

### Phase 2: MCP Server Assessment  
1. Review `mcp/` Rust-based implementation
2. Test MCP protocol functionality
3. Document current tool integration capabilities
4. Assess performance and identify bottlenecks

### Phase 3: Container Infrastructure Testing
1. Build and test each CLI Docker image
2. **Research CLI requirements using docs MCP server**:
   - `codex_query("docker installation requirements and runtime configuration")`
   - `openhands_query("python virtualenv setup and CLI dependencies")`
   - `gemini_query("npm installation and Google API authentication")`
   - `qwen_query("installation via npm and model configuration patterns")`
   - `grok_query("bun installation requirements and X.AI API setup")`
   - `opencode_query("TypeScript CLI setup and MCP server integration")`
   - Cross-reference docs research with actual Dockerfile implementations
   - Document CLI-specific dependencies and environment requirements
3. Document configuration requirements per CLI based on research
4. Verify runtime functionality
5. Identify broken or incomplete images

### Phase 4: Deployment Pipeline Review
1. Analyze existing GitOps configurations
2. Test current ArgoCD application deployments
3. Review CI/CD pipeline effectiveness
4. Document manual deployment steps

### Phase 5: Gap Analysis and Recommendations
1. Create comprehensive current-state documentation
2. Identify missing functionality
3. Prioritize development needs
4. Provide recommendations for next steps

## Dependencies
