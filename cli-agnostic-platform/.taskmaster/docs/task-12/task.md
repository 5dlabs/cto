# Task 12: Production Hardening and Performance Optimization

## Overview
Implement reliability patterns, performance optimizations, security hardening, and operational excellence features for production deployment.

## Technical Specification

### 1. Reliability Patterns
```rust
pub struct ReliabilityManager {
    circuit_breakers: HashMap<String, CircuitBreaker>,
    request_hedger: RequestHedger,
    connection_pools: ConnectionPoolManager,
    timeout_adapter: AdaptiveTimeoutManager,
}

// Circuit breakers with 50% failure threshold
// Request hedging for p95 latency improvement
// Adaptive timeouts based on historical data
// Graceful degradation to simpler models
```

### 2. Performance Optimizations
```rust
pub struct PerformanceOptimizer {
    lazy_loader: LazyComponentLoader,
    request_coalescer: RequestCoalescer,
    cost_optimizer: CostOptimizer,
    cache_warmer: CacheWarmingStrategy,
}

// Lazy loading reduces startup time by 60%
// Request coalescing within 100ms windows
// Cost optimization with model selection
// Connection pooling with bb8
```

### 3. Security Hardening
- Zero-trust networking with mTLS
- OWASP dependency scanning
- Snyk vulnerability monitoring
- Code pattern analysis with Semgrep
- SOC2 and GDPR compliance logging
- Regular security audits

### 4. Operational Excellence
- SLO monitoring (99.9% availability)
- Chaos engineering with Litmus
- Comprehensive runbooks
- Automated incident response
- Cost monitoring and optimization

## Success Criteria
- Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures
- Request hedging reduces p99 latency by 30%
- Startup time under 5 seconds with lazy loading
- Zero critical vulnerabilities in security scans
- SLOs maintained under 10x normal traffic
- Chaos tests don't cause data loss
