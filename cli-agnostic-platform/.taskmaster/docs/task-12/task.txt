# Task 12: Production Hardening and Performance Optimization

## Description
Implement reliability patterns, performance optimizations, security hardening, and operational excellence features for production deployment

## Implementation Details
Implement circuit breakers using tower-rs v0.5.0 with failure threshold 50% over 10 requests. Add request hedging for critical operations with 95th percentile trigger. Build connection pooling with bb8 v0.8.0 for database connections. Implement lazy loading for CLI components reducing startup time by 60%. Add request coalescing for duplicate requests within 100ms window. Create adaptive timeout adjustment based on historical latency. Implement graceful degradation falling back to simpler models on overload. Add cost optimization selecting cheapest capable model for task. Build security scanning with OWASP dependency check, Snyk for vulnerabilities, and Semgrep for code patterns. Implement zero-trust networking with mTLS between services. Add compliance logging for SOC2 and GDPR requirements. Create chaos engineering tests with Litmus framework. Build SLO monitoring with 99.9% availability target.

## Test Strategy
Circuit breakers open after threshold failures. Request hedging reduces p99 latency by 30%. Connection pools handle connection failures gracefully. Lazy loading reduces startup time below 5 seconds. Security scans find no critical vulnerabilities. Chaos tests don't cause data loss. SLOs maintained under load testing with 10x normal traffic.
