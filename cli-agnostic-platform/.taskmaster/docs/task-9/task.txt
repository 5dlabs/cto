# Task 9: Implement Authentication and Secret Management

## Description
Build secure credential handling for API keys, OAuth tokens, and session management across different CLI authentication patterns

## Implementation Details
Create controller/src/auth/manager.rs with AuthManager struct. Implement credential providers: KubernetesSecretProvider using k8s-openapi v0.23.0, VaultProvider for HashiCorp Vault integration, EnvironmentProvider for development. Build authentication strategies: ApiKeyAuth for usage-based billing (OpenAI, Anthropic), OAuthTokenAuth with PKCE flow for session-based auth, HeadlessAuth for CLI login flows. Implement secure storage using AES-256-GCM encryption at rest. Add automatic token refresh with 15-minute buffer before expiry. Create credential rotation scheduler with zero-downtime updates. Implement audit logging to separate security log with structured events. Build rate limiting per API key to prevent abuse. Add authentication cache to reduce provider API calls. Create fallback authentication chain for high availability.

## Test Strategy
Test each provider retrieves credentials correctly. Verify encryption/decryption with known test vectors. Test OAuth flow with mock authorization server. Verify token refresh happens before expiry. Test credential rotation doesn't cause downtime. Audit log contains all authentication events. Rate limiting prevents excessive API usage.
