# Task 11: Implement Migration Tools and Rollout Strategy

## Description
Build automated migration utilities for transitioning agents between CLIs with validation, rollback capabilities, and gradual rollout controls

## Implementation Details
Create controller/src/migration/mod.rs with migration orchestrator. Build configuration converters: CLAUDE.md to AGENTS.md translator, JSON to TOML converter for Codex, prompt adaptation for model differences. Implement migration validator checking configuration compatibility, tool availability, and model support. Create rollout controller with percentage-based traffic splitting using Istio/Envoy. Build A/B testing framework comparing response quality, latency, and cost. Implement automatic rollback triggers on error rate > 5%, latency > 2x baseline, or cost > 1.5x threshold. Create shadow mode running new CLI in parallel without user impact. Build migration state machine with stages: Planning, Testing, Canary (10%), Rollout (25%, 50%), Complete. Add migration metrics dashboard showing progress and issues. Create dry-run mode for risk-free testing.

## Test Strategy
Configuration converters produce valid output formats. Migration validator catches incompatibilities. Traffic splitting routes correct percentage. A/B tests measure differences accurately. Rollback triggers activate on threshold breach. Shadow mode doesn't affect production. State machine transitions correctly. Dry-run doesn't modify any state.
