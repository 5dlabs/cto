# Task 11: Implement Migration Tools and Rollout Strategy

## Overview
Build automated migration utilities for transitioning agents between CLIs with validation, rollback capabilities, and gradual rollout controls.

## Technical Specification

### 1. Migration Orchestrator
```rust
pub struct MigrationOrchestrator {
    config_converters: HashMap<(CLIType, CLIType), Box<dyn ConfigConverter>>,
    validator: MigrationValidator,
    rollout_controller: RolloutController,
    ab_tester: ABTestingFramework,
    metrics: MigrationMetrics,
}

pub enum MigrationStage {
    Planning,
    Testing,
    Canary(u8),    // Percentage
    Rollout(u8),   // Percentage
    Complete,
}
```

### 2. Configuration Converters
```rust
pub trait ConfigConverter: Send + Sync {
    async fn convert(&self, from: &AgentConfig, to: CLIType) -> Result<AgentConfig>;
    fn supports_conversion(&self, from: CLIType, to: CLIType) -> bool;
}

pub struct ClaudeToCodexConverter;
pub struct PromptAdapter;
pub struct MemoryFileTranslator;
```

### 3. Rollout Features
- Percentage-based traffic splitting
- A/B testing with quality metrics
- Automatic rollback triggers
- Shadow mode for risk-free testing
- Migration state machine
- Dry-run mode for testing

## Success Criteria
- Configuration converters produce valid outputs
- Migration validator catches incompatibilities
- Traffic splitting routes correct percentages
- Automatic rollback triggers on thresholds
- A/B tests measure quality differences
- Shadow mode doesn't affect production
