			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Project Structure and Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project initialization into: 1) Create Rust workspace structure with controller crate and proper Cargo.toml configuration, 2) Set up TypeScript/Node.js MCP directory with package.json and @modelcontextprotocol/sdk dependency, 3) Create Docker infrastructure directories for each CLI (claude, codex, opencode, gemini, grok, qwen, cursor, openhands), 4) Configure GitHub Actions workflow with multi-arch build support, 5) Create comprehensive Makefile with build, test, and deploy targets, 6) Initialize git repository with proper .gitignore entries, 7) Set up development environment configuration files, 8) Create initial README and documentation structure",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational task starting from scratch. While straightforward, it requires setting up multiple technology stacks (Rust, TypeScript, Docker) and CI/CD infrastructure. The complexity comes from coordinating multiple build systems and ensuring proper workspace configuration."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement CLI-Aware Model Validation Framework",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement the model validation framework with: 1) Create trait-based validation architecture in controller/src/cli/validation.rs, 2) Implement ClaudeModelValidator with comprehensive Claude model patterns, 3) Create OpenAIModelValidator for GPT/O-series models, 4) Build GoogleModelValidator for Gemini models, 5) Implement validators for Grok, Qwen, and other providers, 6) Create ModelCatalog registry with version support, 7) Implement fuzzy matching and suggestion system for typos, 8) Build validation caching mechanism with TTL, 9) Add model capability metadata system, 10) Create comprehensive unit and integration tests",
			"reasoning": "This requires implementing a complex trait system with multiple provider-specific validators. Each validator needs detailed knowledge of model naming patterns, version support, and capability metadata. The fuzzy matching and caching add additional complexity layers."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Design and Implement CLI Adapter Trait System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create the adapter system with: 1) Design CliAdapter trait with core async methods for validation, config generation, and execution, 2) Implement BaseAdapter with shared logging and error handling, 3) Create AdapterFactory with pattern matching for CLI type selection, 4) Implement lifecycle hooks for initialization and cleanup, 5) Build configuration system with per-CLI defaults, 6) Integrate OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, 7) Create async execution methods for file operations, 8) Implement prompt formatting and response parsing, 9) Build container initialization logic, 10) Create adapter registry and discovery mechanism, 11) Implement health check and readiness probes, 12) Write comprehensive test suite with mocks",
			"reasoning": "This is the core abstraction layer requiring careful design of async traits, lifecycle management, and complex interaction patterns. The trait system must be flexible enough to handle diverse CLI behaviors while maintaining type safety and performance."

		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Configuration Resolution Engine",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 11,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build the configuration resolver with: 1) Create AgentResolver struct with multi-source loading, 2) Implement Helm ConfigMap configuration loading, 3) Build Git integration for cto-config.json retrieval, 4) Create field-level merge strategies (Replace, Merge, Append, DeepMerge), 5) Implement JSONSchema validation with jsonschema-rs, 6) Build precedence rules engine (Runtime > Environment > CtoConfig > Helm), 7) Implement Redis caching with TTL management, 8) Create configuration preview API, 9) Build audit trail logging system, 10) Implement backwards compatibility handling, 11) Create comprehensive test suite for merge scenarios",
			"reasoning": "This involves complex JSON manipulation, multiple data sources, sophisticated merge strategies, and caching. The field-level granularity and precedence rules add significant complexity, plus integration with Redis and schema validation."

			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create Template Management System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement template management with: 1) Create TemplateManager with registry architecture, 2) Integrate Handlebars-rust with custom helpers, 3) Implement template discovery from filesystem, 4) Build fallback chain logic (CLI-specific -> Generic -> Default), 5) Create template context builder with agent metadata, 6) Implement template validation and syntax checking, 7) Add hot-reloading with notify-rs for development, 8) Build template versioning system, 9) Create performance cache for compiled templates",
			"reasoning": "While template management is a well-understood pattern, the multi-level fallback system, hot-reloading, and versioning add complexity. Integration with Handlebars and custom helpers requires careful implementation."

			"reasoning": "This requires handling multiple transport patterns (streaming, buffered, STDIO) with different complexity levels. The retry logic, compression, and connection pooling add significant implementation complexity in TypeScript."

			"reasoning": "Implementing two different adapters with distinct configuration formats (Markdown vs TOML) and authentication patterns (API key vs OAuth) requires significant effort. The Codex adapter has additional complexity with sandbox presets and experimental features."
