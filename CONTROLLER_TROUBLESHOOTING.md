# Controller Troubleshooting Analysis

## Problem Summary

**Issue**: DocsRun controller is processing resources (creates ConfigMaps, adds finalizers) but does NOT create Kubernetes Jobs, despite appearing to reconcile successfully.

**Symptoms**:
- ✅ DocsRun CRD applied successfully
- ✅ ConfigMap created with comprehensive container script
- ✅ Finalizer added to DocsRun resource
- ❌ No Kubernetes Job created
- ❌ No logs showing job creation attempt
- ❌ Hard to delete DocsRuns (stuck finalizers)
- ❌ No error messages in controller logs

## ⚠️ CRITICAL UPDATE: Phase 1 Testing Results

**HYPOTHESIS DISPROVEN**: Disabling cleanup logic did NOT resolve the issue.

### New Evidence (After Disabling Cleanup):
- ❌ **Still no Job creation** despite cleanup being disabled
- ❌ **NO RECONCILIATION LOGS** visible in controller output
- ✅ **ConfigMap still created** (proves controller ran at least once)
- ✅ **Finalizer still added** (proves controller interaction)

### **New Critical Finding**: SILENT RECONCILIATION
The controller is running reconciliation **silently** - no logs appear for the actual reconciliation process, only health checks. This suggests:

1. **Silent panic/error** during reconciliation that's being swallowed
2. **Log level filtering** preventing reconciliation logs from appearing
3. **Background spawning** still hiding logs despite cleanup being disabled
4. **Different error path** that doesn't produce visible logs

## Changes Made Today vs. Yesterday

### 1. **Controller-Based Cleanup Logic** ❌ **NOT THE CAUSE**

**Status**: ✅ **RULED OUT** - Disabling cleanup logic did not resolve the issue

### 2. **Configuration Loading Method** (NOW HIGH SUSPICION)

**What changed**: Switched from async API calls to sync file reading

```rust
// OLD (working):
ControllerConfig::from_configmap(client, &namespace, "config-name").await?

// NEW (current):
ControllerConfig::from_mounted_file("/config/config.yaml")
```

**New Risk Analysis**:
- ⚠️ **Silent panic in config loading** not visible in logs
- ⚠️ **Sync vs async context problems** causing deadlock
- ⚠️ **Missing await or blocking** causing reconciliation to hang
- ⚠️ **Error handling differences** swallowing critical errors

### 3. **Missing Debug Logging** (NEW SUSPICION)

**What's missing**: Our detailed debug logging from `reconcile.rs` is NOT appearing:

```rust
// EXPECTED but NOT SEEN in logs:
debug!("About to load controller configuration from mounted file...");
info!("✅ Successfully loaded controller configuration from mounted file");
```

**Risk Analysis**:
- ⚠️ **Log level configuration** preventing debug output
- ⚠️ **Early panic** before debug logs are reached
- ⚠️ **Reconciliation not triggering** due to controller setup issue

## Evidence Analysis

### What's Working ✅

1. **Controller Startup**: Logs show successful initialization
   ```
   INFO orchestrator_core: Starting task controller in namespace: orchestrator
   INFO kube_runtime::controller: press ctrl+c to shut down gracefully (x2)
   ```

2. **Resource Processing**: ConfigMap creation proves controller ran at least once
3. **Finalizer Management**: DocsRun has finalizer indicating controller interaction

### What's Broken ❌

1. **Reconciliation Logging**: NO logs for actual reconciliation attempts
2. **Job Creation**: ConfigMap created but Job creation step never reached
3. **Status Updates**: DocsRun status field remains empty
4. **Events**: No Kubernetes events generated

### **NEW Critical Observation**: The controller is reconciling **invisibly**

- Evidence controller ran: ConfigMap + Finalizer ✅
- Visible reconciliation logs: None ❌
- This suggests a **silent failure** in the reconciliation path

## Updated Hypothesis: Configuration Loading Issue

**New Primary Theory**: The sync file-based configuration loading is causing a silent panic or hang.

### Supporting Evidence:
- ConfigMap created (early reconciliation step) ✅
- Configuration loading happens early in reconciliation ⚠️
- No reconciliation logs appear (suggests early failure) ❌
- Debug logging we added around config loading is missing ❌

### Potential Issues:
1. **Sync file I/O blocking** the async reconciliation context
2. **Permission/access issue** on `/config/config.yaml` causing panic
3. **Serde deserialization panic** despite our `#[serde(default)]` fix
4. **Missing await** in async context when calling sync function

## **URGENT Action Plan**

### **Phase 2**: Add Aggressive Reconciliation Logging
1. Add `error!()` logs around EVERY step of reconciliation
2. Add logging immediately before and after config loading
3. Use `tracing::error!` that should always be visible
4. Test with simple config loading vs. complex validation

### **Phase 3**: Test Config Loading in Isolation
1. Temporarily remove config loading to test basic reconciliation
2. Add config loading back step by step
3. Test sync vs async config loading methods

### **Phase 4**: Emergency Fallback
1. Revert to old async `from_configmap` method temporarily
2. Confirm job creation works with old config loading
3. Debug the file-based loading separately

## Files to Examine URGENTLY

### Primary Suspects (UPDATED):
- **`orchestrator/core/src/controllers/task_controller/reconcile.rs`** - Missing debug logs
- **`orchestrator/core/src/controllers/task_controller/config.rs`** - Sync file loading
- **`orchestrator/core/src/controllers/task_controller/resources.rs`** - Job creation path

### Log Configuration:
- **RUST_LOG environment variable** - May be filtering reconciliation logs
- **Tracing configuration** - May need more aggressive log levels

## Next Steps (UPDATED)

**Phase 2**: Add error-level logging around every reconciliation step ⏰ **IMMEDIATE**
**Phase 3**: Test config loading in isolation
**Phase 4**: Consider emergency revert to async config loading if file-based approach is fundamentally broken
