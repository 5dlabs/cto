# GitHub Apps Automation Options

## 🎯 The Reality

GitHub has security restrictions on app creation:
- **Manifest Flow**: Requires browser confirmation (security feature)
- **Direct API**: Requires org owner PAT with `admin:org` scope
- **No fully headless option** for security reasons

## 🚀 Your Options (Fastest to Most Automated)

### Option 1: Quick Manual Setup (15 minutes)
**Best for**: Getting started immediately

```bash
# Just create one app manually to test
1. Go to: https://github.com/organizations/5dlabs/settings/apps/new
2. Fill in the form (takes 2 minutes)
3. Download private key
4. Run our quick setup script to store credentials
```

✅ **Pros**: Fastest to first working agent
❌ **Cons**: Manual process for each agent

### Option 2: Semi-Automated Script (1 hour for all agents)
**Best for**: Balance of automation and simplicity

```bash
./scripts/quick-agent-app-setup.sh
# Creates manifest, opens browser, stores credentials
# Repeat for each agent (or modify for batch)
```

✅ **Pros**: Handles credential storage automatically
❌ **Cons**: Still requires browser clicks

### Option 3: Terraform (Most Maintainable)
**Best for**: Long-term infrastructure as code

```hcl
# terraform/github-apps.tf
resource "github_app" "morgan" {
  name        = "5DLabs-Morgan"
  description = "Product Management Agent"
  
  permissions = {
    contents      = "write"
    pull_requests = "write"
    issues        = "write"
  }
}
```

✅ **Pros**: Fully declarative, version controlled
❌ **Cons**: Requires Terraform setup

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Start with Option 1** - Create just Morgan manually:
1. Takes 15 minutes
2. Proves the concept works
3. Unblocks your docs workflow testing
4. Then automate the rest later

## 📝 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# After creating Morgan app manually:

# 1. Store credentials (replace with your values)
kubectl create secret generic github-app-morgan \
  --namespace=agent-platform \
  --from-literal=app-id=12345 \
  --from-file=private-key=morgan.private-key.pem

# 2. Update your workflow template
# Change: githubUser: "pm0-5dlabs"
# To: githubApp: "5DLabs-Morgan"

# 3. Test it!
```

The key insight: **You don't need all 13 agents to start**. Get Morgan working, prove the approach, then scale up.
